       " Document(metadata={'source': 'rag_docs/Normal - Google Docs.pdf', 'filename': 'Normal - Google Docs.pdf'}, page_content=' Mental illness vs mental health: what’s the difference? \\n Mental health and mental illness are not simply two sides of the same coin. Mental health, just \\n like physical health, exists on a spectrum from poor to optimal. \\n With physical health, some days we naturally feel stronger and more energetic than others. \\n Similarly, some days our mental health is worse than others, and that too is a natural part of \\n being human. We may feel tired, grumpy, sad, angry, anxious, depressed, stressed, or even \\n happy at any point in time. These are all normal human emotions, and aren’t on their own a sign \\n of mental illness. \\n How The Conversation is different: We explain without oversimplifying. \\n Someone living with a mental illness can be experiencing optimal mental health at any point in \\n time, while someone else can feel sad or low even in the absence of a mental illness. \\n Differentiating between poor mental health and symptoms of a mental illness is not always \\n clear-cut. When poor mental health has a sustained negative impact on someone’s ability to \\n work, have meaningful relationships, and fulfil day-to-day tasks, it could be a sign of mental \\n illness requiring treatment. \\n Mental health and mental illness are not the same thing. You can have poor mental health in the \\n absence of a mental illness. Supplied, adapted from Keyes 2002. \\n What does positive mental health look like? \\n Mental health is more than just the absence of mental illness. \\n Positive mental health and well-being is a combination of feeling good and functioning well. \\n Important components include: \\n experiencing positive emotions: happiness, joy, pride, satisfaction, and love \\n having positive relationships: people you care for, and who care for you \\n feeling engaged with life \\n meaning and purpose: feeling your life is valuable and worthwhile \\n a sense of accomplishment: doing things that give you a sense of achievement or competence \\n emotional stability: feeling calm and able to manage emotions \\n resilience: the ability to cope with the stresses of daily life  optimism: feeling positive about your life and future \\n self-esteem: feeling positive about yourself \\n vitality: feeling energetic. \\n How can I cultivate my mental health? \\n Your mental health is shaped by social, economic, genetic and environmental conditions. To \\n improve mental health within society at large, we need to address the social determinants of \\n poor mental health, including poverty, economic insecurity, unemployment, low education, social \\n disadvantage, homelessness and social isolation. \\n Positive mental health involves being able to cope with the challenges of daily life. Shutterstock \\n On an individual level, there are steps you can take to optimise your mental health. The first \\n step is identifying your existing support networks and the coping strategies that you’ve used in \\n the past. \\n There are also small things you can do to improve your mental health and help you to cope in \\n tough times, such as: \\n helping others \\n finding a type of exercise or physical activity you enjoy (like yoga) \\n getting good sleep \\n eating healthy food \\n connecting with others, building and maintaining positive relationships \\n learning strategies to manage stress \\n having realistic expectations (no one is happy and positive all the time) \\n learning ways to relax (such as meditation) \\n counteracting negative or overcritical thinking \\n doing things you enjoy and that give you a sense of accomplishment.

While these thoughts \\n don’t always lead to action, they can be a warning sign. Treatment is available. \\n **What is suicidal ideation?** \\n Suicidal ideation varies by person—ranging from passive thoughts (e.g., wishing not to wake \\n up) to active planning. It can escalate without intervention. \\n **Key Statistics** \\n - 5% of U.S. adults experience suicidal thoughts annually. \\n - 18% of U.S. children under 18 consider suicide. \\n **Types of Suicidal Ideation** \\n - **Passive:** Thoughts without a plan to act. \\n - **Active:** Thoughts with intent or a plan (e.g., giving away valuables). \\n **Diagnosis** \\n Healthcare providers use assessments like the **Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale \\n (C-SSRS)** to evaluate severity. Sample questions: \\n - \"Have you wished you were dead?\" \\n - \"Do you have a suicide plan?\" \\n **Common Causes** \\n - Mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, psychosis). \\n - Biological/genetic factors. \\n - Stress, trauma, or interpersonal conflicts. \\n - Substance use disorders. \\n **Treatment Options** \\n - **Safety plans** with coping strategies and emergency contacts. \\n - **Therapy** (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy). \\n - **Medications** for underlying conditions. \\n - **Inpatient/outpatient programs** for severe cases. \\n **Immediate Help** \\n - Call/text **988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) for 24/7 support. \\n - Confide in a trusted person. \\n - Avoid alcohol/drugs. \\n **Complications** \\n Untreated ideation can lead to self-harm or suicide.  **Prevention** \\n While thoughts can’t always be prevented, early intervention reduces risks. Warning signs \\n include: \\n - Social withdrawal. \\n - Expressing hopelessness. \\n **When to Seek Help** \\n - If thoughts persist or escalate. \\n - If you’ve made a plan. \\n - If you’re using substances to cope.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'rag_docs/OCD - Google Docs.pdf', 'filename': 'OCD - Google Docs.pdf'}, page_content=' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder \\n Diagnostic Criteria 300.3 (F42) \\n A. Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both: \\n Obsessions are defined by (1) and (2): \\n 1. Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some \\n time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most individuals \\n cause marked anxiety or distress. \\n 2. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images, or to \\n neutralize them with some other thought or action (i.e., by performing a compulsion). \\n Compulsions are defined by (1) and (2): \\n 1. Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., \\n praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to per- \\n form in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. \\n 2. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or dis- \\n tress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or \\n mental acts are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neu- \\n tralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive. \\n Note: Young children may not be able to articulate the aims of these behaviors or \\n mental acts. \\n B. The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1 hour per \\n day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or \\n other important areas of functioning. \\n C. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects \\n of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. \\n D. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder \\n (e.g., excessive worries, as in generalized anxiety disorder; preoccupation with ap- \\n pearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder; difficulty discarding or parting with posses- \\n sions, as in hoarding disorder; hair pulling, as in trichotillomania [hair-pulling disorder]; \\n skin picking, as in excoriation [skin-picking] disorder; stereotypies, as in stereotypic \\n movement disorder; ritualized eating behavior, as in eating disorders; preoccupation \\n with substances or gambling, as in substance-related and addictive disorders; preoc- \\n cupation with having an illness, as in illness anxiety disorder; sexual urges or fantasies, \\n as in paraphilic disorders; impulses, as in disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct dis- \\n orders; guilty ruminations, as in major depressive disorder; thought insertion or delu- \\n sional preoccupations, as in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; or  repetitive patterns of behavior, as in autism spectrum disorder). \\n Specify if: \\n With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that obsessive-compulsive dis- \\n order beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true. \\n With poor insight: The individual thinks obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are \\n probably true. \\n With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that \\n obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true. \\n Specify if: \\n Tic-related: The individual has a current or past history of a tic disorder. \\n 238 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders \\n Specifiers \\n Many individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have dysfunctional beliefs. \\n These beliefs can include an inflated sense of responsibility and the tendency to overesti- \\n mate threat; perfectionism and intolerance of uncertainty; and over-importance of thoughts \\n (e.g., believing that having a forbidden thought is as bad as acting on it) and the need to \\n control thoughts. \\n Individuals with OCD vary in the degree of insight they have about the accuracy of the \\n beliefs that underlie their obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Many individuals have good or \\n fair insight (e.g., the individual believes that the house definitely will not, probably will not, \\n or may or may not burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times). Some have poor insight \\n (e.g., the individual believes that the house will probably burn down if the stove is not \\n checked 30 times), and a few (4% or less) have absent insight/delusional beliefs (e.g., the in- \\n dividual is convinced that the house will burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times). \\n Insight can vary within an individual over the course of the illness. Poorer insight has been \\n linked to worse long-term outcome. \\n Up to 30% of individuals with OCD have a lifetime tic disorder. This is most common \\n in males with onset of OCD in childhood. These individuals tend to differ from those with- \\n out a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD symptoms, comorbidity, course, \\n and pattern of familial transmission. \\n Diagnostic Features \\n The characteristic symptoms of OCD are the presence of obsessions and compulsions (Cri- \\n terion A). Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images  (e.g., of violent or horrific scenes), or urges (e.g., to stab someone). Importantly, obsessions \\n are not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary: they are intrusive and unwanted and \\n cause marked distress or anxiety in most individuals. The individual attempts to ignore or \\n suppress these obsessions (e.g., avoiding triggers or using thought suppression) or to neu- \\n tralize them with another thought or action (e.g., performing a compulsion). Compulsions \\n (or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e.g., washing, checking) or mental acts (e.g., counting, \\n repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an \\n obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Most individuals with OCD \\n have both obsessions and compulsions. Compulsions are typically performed in response \\n to an obsession (e.g., thoughts of contamination leading to washing rituals or that some- \\n thing is incorrect leading to repeating rituals until it feels “just right”). The aim is to reduce \\n the distress triggered by obsessions or to prevent a feared event (e.g., becoming ill). How- \\n ever, these compulsions either are not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g., \\n arranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive \\n (e.g., showering for hours each day). Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some \\n individuals experience relief from anxiety or distress. \\n Criterion B emphasizes that obsessions and compulsions must be time-consuming (e.g., \\n more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment to warrant \\n a diagnosis of OCD. This criterion helps to distinguish the disorder from the occasional in- \\n trusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors that are common in the general population (e.g., \\n double-checking that a door is locked). The frequency and severity of obsessions and com- \\n pulsions vary across individuals with OCD (e.g., some have mild to moderate symptoms, \\n spending 1–3 hours per day obsessing or doing compulsions, whereas others have nearly \\n constant intrusive thoughts or compulsions that can be incapacitating). \\n Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis \\n The specific content of obsessions and compulsions varies between individuals. However, \\n certain themes, or dimensions, are common, including those of cleaning (contamination \\n obsessions and cleaning compulsions); symmetry (symmetry obsessions and repeating, \\n Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder 239 \\n ordering, and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo thoughts (e.g., aggressive, sexual, \\n or religious obsessions and related compulsions); and harm (e.g., fears of harm to oneself \\n or others and checking compulsions). Some individuals also have difficulties discarding \\n and accumulate (hoard) objects as a consequence of typical obsessions and compulsions, \\n such as fears of harming others. These themes occur across different cultures, are rela-  tively consistent over time in adults with the disorder, and may be associated with differ- \\n ent neural substrates. Importantly, individuals often have symptoms in more than one \\n dimension. \\n Individuals with OCD experience a range of affective responses when confronted with \\n situations that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, many individuals expe- \\n rience marked anxiety that can include recurrent panic attacks. Others report strong feel- \\n ings of disgust. While performing compulsions, some individuals report a distressing \\n sense of “incompleteness” or uneasiness until things look, feel, or sound “just right.” \\n It is common for individuals with the disorder to avoid people, places, and things that \\n trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, individuals with contamination con- \\n cerns might avoid public situations (e.g., restaurants, public restrooms) to reduce ex- \\n posure to feared contaminants; individuals with intrusive thoughts about causing harm \\n might avoid social interactions. \\n Prevalence \\n The 12-month prevalence of OCD in the United States is 1.2%, with a similar prevalence in- \\n ternationally (1.1%–1.8%). Females are affected at a slightly higher rate than males in \\n adulthood, although males are more commonly affected in childhood. \\n Development and Course \\n In the United States, the mean age at onset of OCD is 19.5 years, and 25% of cases start by \\n age 14 years. Onset after age 35 years is unusual but does occur. Males have an earlier age \\n at onset than females: nearly 25% of males have onset before age 10 years. The onset of \\n symptoms is typically gradual; however, acute onset has also been reported. \\n If OCD is untreated, the course is usually chronic, often with waxing and waning symp- \\n toms. Some individuals have an episodic course, and a minority have a deteriorating \\n course. Without treatment, remission rates in adults are low (e.g., 20% for those reevalu- \\n ated 40 years later). Onset in childhood or adolescence can lead to a lifetime of OCD. How- \\n ever, 40% of individuals with onset of OCD in childhood or adolescence may experience \\n remission by early adulthood. The course of OCD is often complicated by the co-occurrence \\n of other disorders (see section “Comorbidity” for this disorder). \\n Compulsions are more easily diagnosed in children than obsessions are because com- \\n pulsions are observable. However, most children have both obsessions and compulsions \\n (as do most adults). The pattern of symptoms in adults can be stable over time, but it is  more variable in children. Some differences in the content of obsessions and compulsions \\n have been reported when children and adolescent samples have been compared with \\n adult samples. These differences likely reflect content appropriate to different develop- \\n mental stages (e.g., higher rates of sexual and religious obsessions in adolescents than in \\n children; higher rates of harm obsessions [e.g., fears of catastrophic events, such as death \\n or illness to self or loved ones] in children and adolescents than in adults). \\n Risk and Prognostic Factors \\n Temperamental. Greater internalizing symptoms, higher negative emotionality, and \\n behavioral inhibition in childhood are possible temperamental risk factors. \\n Environmental. Physical and sexual abuse in childhood and other stressful or traumatic \\n events have been associated with an increased risk for developing OCD. Some children \\n 240 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders \\n may develop the sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, which has been asso- \\n ciated with different environmental factors, including various infectious agents and a \\n post-infectious autoimmune syndrome. \\n Genetic and physiological. The rate of OCD among first-degree relatives of adults with \\n OCD is approximately two times that among first-degree relatives of those without the \\n disorder; however, among first-degree relatives of individuals with onset of OCD in child- \\n hood or adolescence, the rate is increased 10-fold. Familial transmission is due in part to \\n genetic factors (e.g., a concordance rate of 0.57 for monozygotic vs. 0.22 for dizygotic twins). \\n Dysfunction in the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and striatum have been \\n most strongly implicated. \\n Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues \\n OCD occurs across the world. There is substantial similarity across cultures in the gender \\n distribution, age at onset, and comorbidity of OCD. Moreover, around the globe, there is a \\n similar symptom structure involving cleaning, symmetry, hoarding, taboo thoughts, or \\n fear of harm. However, regional variation in symptom expression exists, and cultural \\n factors may shape the content of obsessions and compulsions. \\n Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues \\n Males have an earlier age at onset of OCD than females and are more likely to have co- \\n morbid tic disorders. Gender differences in the pattern of symptom dimensions have been \\n reported, with, for example, females more likely to have symptoms in the cleaning dimen- \\n sion and males more likely to have symptoms in the forbidden thoughts and symmetry di- \\n mensions. Onset or exacerbation of OCD, as well as symptoms that can interfere with the  mother-infant relationship (e.g., aggressive obsessions leading to avoidance of the infant), \\n have been reported in the peripartum period. \\n Suicide Risk \\n Suicidal thoughts occur at some point in as many as about half of individuals with OCD. \\n Suicide attempts are also reported in up to one-quarter of individuals with OCD; the pres- \\n ence of comorbid major depressive disorder increases the risk. \\n Functional Consequences of \\n Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder \\n OCD is associated with reduced quality of life as well as high levels of social and occupa- \\n tional impairment. Impairment occurs across many different domains of life and is asso- \\n ciated with symptom severity. Impairment can be caused by the time spent obsessing and \\n doing compulsions. Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions or compulsions \\n can also severely restrict functioning. In addition, specific symptoms can create specific \\n obstacles. For example, obsessions about harm can make relationships with family and \\n friends feel hazardous; the result can be avoidance of these relationships. Obsessions \\n about symmetry can derail the timely completion of school or work projects because the \\n project never feels “just right,” potentially resulting in school failure or job loss. Health \\n consequences can also occur. For example, individuals with contamination concerns may \\n avoid doctors’ offices and hospitals (e.g., because of fears of exposure to germs) or develop \\n dermatological problems (e.g., skin lesions due to excessive washing). Sometimes the \\n symptoms of the disorder interfere with its own treatment (e.g., when medications are con- \\n sidered contaminated). When the disorder starts in childhood or adolescence, individuals \\n may experience developmental difficulties. For example, adolescents may avoid socializ- \\n ing with peers; young adults may struggle when they leave home to live independently. \\n Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder 241 \\n The result can be few significant relationships outside the family and a lack of autonomy \\n and financial independence from their family of origin. In addition, some individuals with \\n OCD try to impose rules and prohibitions on family members because of their disorder \\n (e.g., no one in the family can have visitors to the house for fear of contamination), and this \\n can lead to family dysfunction. \\n Differential Diagnosis \\n Anxiety disorders. Recurrent thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and repetitive requests for \\n reassurance can also occur in anxiety disorders. However, the recurrent thoughts that are \\n present in generalized anxiety disorder (i.e., worries) are usually about real-life concerns, \\n whereas the obsessions of OCD usually do not involve real-life concerns and can include \\n content that is odd, irrational, or of a seemingly magical nature; moreover, compulsions  are often present and usually linked to the obsessions. Like individuals with OCD, indi- \\n viduals with specific phobia can have a fear reaction to specific objects or situations; how- \\n ever, in specific phobia the feared object is usually much more circumscribed, and rituals \\n are not present. In social anxiety disorder (social phobia), the feared objects or situations \\n are limited to social interactions, and avoidance or reassurance seeking is focused on re- \\n ducing this social fear. \\n Major depressive disorder. OCD can be distinguished from the rumination of major \\n depressive disorder, in which thoughts are usually mood-congruent and not necessarily \\n experienced as intrusive or distressing; moreover, ruminations are not linked to compul- \\n sions, as is typical in OCD. \\n Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. In body dysmorphic disorder, the \\n obsessions and compulsions are limited to concerns about physical appearance; and in \\n trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), the compulsive behavior is limited to hair pulling \\n in the absence of obsessions. Hoarding disorder symptoms focus exclusively on the per- \\n sistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, marked distress associated with \\n discarding items, and excessive accumulation of objects. However, if an individual has ob- \\n sessions that are typical of OCD (e.g., concerns about incompleteness or harm), and these \\n obsessions lead to compulsive hoarding behaviors (e.g., acquiring all objects in a set to at- \\n tain a sense of completeness or not discarding old newspapers because they may contain \\n information that could prevent harm), a diagnosis of OCD should be given instead. \\n Eating disorders. OCD can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa in that in OCD the \\n obsessions and compulsions are not limited to concerns about weight and food. \\n Tics (in tic disorder) and stereotyped movements. A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, \\n nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization (e.g., eye blinking, throat clearing). A ste- \\n reotyped movement is a repetitive, seemingly driven, nonfunctional motor behavior (e.g., \\n head banging, body rocking, self-biting). Tics and stereotyped movements are typically \\n less complex than compulsions and are not aimed at neutralizing obsessions. However, \\n distinguishing between complex tics and compulsions can be difficult. Whereas compul- \\n sions are usually preceded by obsessions, tics are often preceded by premonitory sensory \\n urges. Some individuals have symptoms of both OCD and a tic disorder, in which case \\n both diagnoses may be warranted.  Psychotic disorders. Some individuals with OCD have poor insight or even delusional \\n OCD beliefs. However, they have obsessions and compulsions (distinguishing their \\n condition from delusional disorder) and do not have other features of schizophrenia or \\n schizoaffective disorder (e.g., hallucinations or formal thought disorder). \\n Other compulsive-like behaviors. Certain behaviors are sometimes described as “com- \\n pulsive,” including sexual behavior (in the case of paraphilias), gambling (i.e., gambling \\n 242 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders \\n disorder), and substance use (e.g., alcohol use disorder). However, these behaviors differ \\n from the compulsions of OCD in that the person usually derives pleasure from the activity \\n and may wish to resist it only because of its deleterious consequences. \\n Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Although obsessive-compulsive person- \\n ality disorder and OCD have similar names, the clinical manifestations of these disorders \\n are quite different. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is not characterized by in- \\n trusive thoughts, images, or urges or by repetitive behaviors that are performed in re- \\n sponse to these intrusions; instead, it involves an enduring and pervasive maladaptive \\n pattern of excessive perfectionism and rigid control. If an individual manifests symptoms \\n of both OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, both diagnoses can be given. \\n Comorbidity \\n Individuals with OCD often have other psychopathology. Many adults with the disorder \\n have a lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (76%; e.g., panic disorder, social anxiety \\n disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia) or a depressive or bipolar disorder \\n (63% for any depressive or bipolar disorder, with the most common being major depres- \\n sive disorder [41%]). Onset of OCD is usually later than for most comorbid anxiety disor- \\n ders (with the exception of separation anxiety disorder) and PTSD but often precedes that \\n of depressive disorders. Comorbid obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is also \\n common in individuals with OCD (e.g., ranging from 23% to 32%). \\n Up to 30% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder. A comorbid tic \\n disorder is most common in males with onset of OCD in childhood. These individuals \\n tend to differ from those without a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD \\n symptoms, comorbidity, course, and pattern of familial transmission. A triad of OCD, tic \\n disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can also be seen in children. \\n Disorders that occur more frequently in individuals with OCD than in those without \\n the disorder include several obsessive-compulsive and related disorders such as body \\n dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-pick- \\n ing) disorder. Finally, an association between OCD and some disorders characterized by  impulsivity, such as oppositional defiant disorder, has been reported. \\n OCD is also much more common in individuals with certain other disorders than \\n would be expected based on its prevalence in the general population; when one of those \\n other disorders is diagnosed, the individual should be assessed for OCD as well. For ex- \\n ample, in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the prevalence of \\n OCD is approximately 12%. Rates of OCD are also elevated in bipolar disorder; eating dis- \\n orders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa; and Tourette’s disorder. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'rag_docs/Stress.pdf', 'filename': 'Stress.pdf'}, page_content=' Stress \\n Stress is the natural reaction your body has when changes or challenges occur. It can result in \\n many different physical, emotional, and behavioral responses. Everyone experiences stress \\n from time to time. You can’t avoid it. But stress management techniques can help you deal with \\n it. \\n **What is stress?** \\n Stress is a natural human reaction that happens to everyone. In fact, your body is designed to \\n experience stress and react to it. When you experience changes or challenges (stressors), your \\n body produces physical and mental responses. \\n **Types of stress** \\n There are three main kinds of stress: \\n - **Acute stress:** Short-term stress that comes and goes quickly (e.g., riding a rollercoaster, an \\n argument). \\n - **Episodic acute stress:** Frequent acute stress (common in high-pressure jobs like \\n healthcare). \\n - **Chronic stress:** Long-term stress lasting weeks/months (e.g., financial problems, work \\n issues). \\n **Symptoms of Stress** \\n - **Physical:** Headaches, dizziness, high blood pressure, digestive issues, chest pain, muscle \\n tension, weakened immune system. \\n - **Psychological:** Anxiety, irritability, depression, panic attacks, sadness. \\n - **Behavioral:** Overeating, substance use, gambling, compulsive behaviors (shopping, \\n internet browsing). \\n **Stress Rash** \\n Pink or discolored raised bumps (hives) triggered by stress. More common in women aged \\n 20–40. Treatable with antihistamines, but stress management is key. \\n **Causes of Stress** \\n - Life changes (marriage, divorce, moving, retirement). \\n - Work/school pressures (exams, presentations). \\n - Daily hassles (traffic, running late). \\n **Complications of Chronic Stress** \\n - Immune system: Arthritis, fibromyalgia. \\n - Digestive system: Ulcers, IBS. \\n - Cardiovascular: High blood pressure, heart palpitations. \\n - Mental health: Depression, anxiety. \\n **Diagnosis**  Stress is subjective; healthcare providers may use questionnaires. Chronic stress symptoms \\n (e.g., hypertension) can be medically evaluated. \\n **Stress Relief & Prevention** \\n - Exercise (even short walks help). \\n - Set daily/weekly goals. \\n - Practice gratitude and relaxation (meditation, yoga). \\n - Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and social connections. \\n - Learn to say \"no\" and accept uncontrollable situations. \\n **When to Seek Help** \\n - Feeling overwhelmed. \\n - Physical health decline. \\n - Symptoms persist despite self-care. \\n - Using drugs/alcohol to cope. \\n **Prognosis** \\n Stress can be short-term or chronic. Management techniques can mitigate its effects. ')]"
