"I have recently looked into reddit and found that this place is actually quite healthy and supportive... I did not know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...I do not think I have much to say, but I look very young for 26 and it seems that is a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened, I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that did not require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story does not sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I do not have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations, but I do not have a circle of friends that is interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or self-promoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I do not promote? Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free, but it is quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason, I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like that is a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways, I do not really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anti-capitalist/materialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk, you would not be ghosted. End: I really do not like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I cannot see that these people are actually hurting inside, but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar.

"Is it good to only focus on 1 goal? What I mean is, for example I have these goals:

1. Find a good job OR start and grow a succesful company
2. Find the one who will marry me in the future
3. Find out which religion is the true one / read the whole bible

So my idea is, I will only work towards one goal at the same time. If I choose goal 1 and I choose to study or gain work experience, then I will not read the bible and I will not be on dating apps, because I should not overwhelm myself and risk a burn-out. If I choose goal 2, I will be very busy with dating apps and alternatives, but I will not have a job and I will not be studying. If I choose 3, I will read the bible a few hours every day, but I will not do any other productive things.

What is the good side of this by my own thought?

1. Whichever goal is the most important one, OR has to be completed the fastest, can get priority and full focus :)
2. By only having one thing to work on, you have less risk of ending up with 0 free time, so you can avoid burn-out and instead, work at your own pace. (careful: do not get lazy)

What is the bad side of this by my own thought?

1. Spending hours everyday on the same goal only, can become boring. Some goals also do not require many hours every day: for example going to the gym. Being in the gym for 5 hours is a terrible idea, so if you have goals that require less time per day, you can actually pick 2 or 3 of these goals to fill your day.
2. Some goals must be worked on at the same time. For example, you should not avoid studying because you're too busy with going to gym. But while you study, going to the gym is still important for your health. So I would call this an exception to this ""1 goal only"" idea.

These days it seems socially acceptable that people do 3 things at the same time: study, have a job, have a social life. Where's the free time to relax? Right it doesnt exist, and even worse, sometimes all these activities take up more than 24 hours a day, which results in someone being overwhelmed and getting behind on everything. Actually this is what I have experienced. Its not a theory, it is very real.

I have a burn-out. I have been stressed 24/7 for a really long time, because I was focusing on too many things at once. I had to get my homework done, I had to spend all my free time on dating apps, I had to go to gym, etc, I had no free time left.

So my plan is to only work on one goal at once, and spend all free time as actual free time, to relax or enjoy it.

"Last year, during the UK lockdown, was the very first time I have ever wanted to die. It got so extreme that I came off of the internet for a few days to try to heal. I did not know what caused it. I will probably never find out. But i did heal...slightly. After about 3 days I realised that I did not want to die and my suicidal thoughts were gone almost instantly but the depression was not. I have spent a year feeling nothing but numbness, guilt and anger. Nothing else. I have had to force a laugh for a year. At one point, I tried to reach out for help but because of covid, no one was there for me in school or in the community. And now I have slipped back into my depression it is numb, but it is emotionally draining.

"I did not realise it was becoming a problem until now. This has been going on ever since I am 13, I guess, now I am 20. I do not remember having passed a single week without masturbating.

"I think I am depressed. I decided to type out and share some of my feelings and thoughts in order to get them off my chest and to hopefully receive some helpful advice or encouraging words from one of the people reading this.I was raised as a Christian and I was a believer until my early teenage years. Then, a relative of mine passed away, very suddenly, from cancer. She was still in her thirties. It made no sense to me. She was a very generous, sweet, hospitable, warm and loving woman. It made me question if there is a god and why he would allow something like this to happen to such a good person. The death of my relative turned me into a bit of a hedonist. My reasoning: Why would I do tedious things, if something like this can happen to anyone? What is the point in studying for a boring test when I could die tomorrow? I knew that the chances of me dying were slim, but there are never guarantees.Then, I identified as an agnostic atheist for a few years, before I finally became an atheist a few years ago. I am now at a point where I believe our existence is merely a coincidence. We are just descendants of monkeys on a tiny blue rock and the unfortunate tragedy is that we can reflect on our own existence. I am the kind of person who tries to make sense of everything. I usually try to be as unbiased as possible and to use facts in order to form my opinion. That is why it is so hard for me to come to terms with the fact that life is very unfair and random.By making smart choices (living healthily, working hard, etc.), you can only increase your chances of living a good life, but there are no guarantees. Our 1 and only life is a game of chance, which is a truth that is hard for me to fathom.The state of the world pisses me off too. Why the fuck is there still racism? Why are LGBTQIA+ people still being treated unfairly? Why are we allowing capitalism, overconsumption and greed to completely destroy our planet? Why are there billionaires? Why are millions of people starving, while others care about buying the latest clothes and gadgets? How am I supposed to care about school when these problems still exist? Perhaps I am just a sensitive little bitch, idk.Speaking of being a bitch, I fucking love my parents and I cannot stomach that someday, they will die. I start crying even just thinking about losing them at some point in the future. I genuinely believe they are some of the best human beings on the earth. I have thought about suicide but I do not think I would be able to do that to my parents, who are my everything. So the harsh reality is that either I will lose them, or they will lose me. So, if I do not want to commit suicide, it is inevitable that I will lose my parents at some point (if I manage to live that long) and that I will have to continue to live life on a planet full of greed and hate. A life that is inextricably linked to suffering. I have heard people say time and time again that life IS suffering, but even when that is seen as a universal truth, that does not mean that it becomes easier to accept that truth. That truth does not suddenly become easier to bear.I have briefly read about Camus (and the myth of Sisyphus) and while I agree with his worldviews and the absurdity of life, I cannot really see myself following the example of Sisyphus. I cannot see how I could accept having to roll the boulder up the hill for the rest of my life.For a few years, the idea of building a legacy intrigued me. What if I could make art or start institutions that could stand the test of time. My name would be cemented in history. Then, I had a shocking realisation. When I die, I will not be there to enjoy the legacy I built. I do not know what to do. I still enjoy sports, hedonism and other forms of escapism, but only because they allow me a temporary escape from life's inherent suffering. Perhaps I am a 'pussy' or a 'coward' but I honestly cannot take it anymore. This existence is overwhelming. Fed up with this unfair and cruel world and life's inherent suffering",Depression,"{""category"": ""Depression""}",2025-04-21 01:29:12.915913,e5-large-v2

"So far I have a referral pending to an outpatient program where I can hopefully get my diagnosis reevaluated. I was originally diagnosed with depression two years ago but that is when I was in a major depressive episode I was depressed for around two years. Now I am realizing that all my life I have been having severe mood swings and sometimes that is what causes me to attempt. I am getting serious about the outpatient program this time and I am making sure to keep a log of all my mood swings and symptoms for an accurate diagnosis. But now, what can I do in the meantime for self care?**here is the story: \[ TRIGGER WARNING \]**Last Thursday I started drinking alcohol around midnight, then woke up in a dissociative state (completely sober) and attempted to hang myself. I tried once and failed, then I cleaned my room for hours before trying again. I called a crisis line and they called me an ambulance.Still in the dissociative state I walked out of the hospital in the gown and no shoes, I got about half way home before someone called the cops on me. I was so detached that I could not feel the pain in my feet. But when I got back to the hospital I realized that my feet were swollen to the size of a melon and I had blood blisters so large I could hardly walk.I have dissociated before but this time it was severe. It looked like in the movies when you see out of a characters eyes (or POV footage) and even now thinking back on it, it does not feel like it was me who walked out of the hospital.I lied and said that I was still drunk when I walked out, and the psychiatrist on duty gave me the option to be admitted or to go home. I chose to go home, and now I am feeling lost, ashamed and embarrassed about what happened.

"TLDR; bf is getting more depressed over time. I am trying so hard to get him the help he needs. I am getting pushed away and its affecting my mental health now. I feel like everything is pointing towards us breaking up.we have been dating for about 1.5 years. I have GAD and moderate/mild depression. I am currently on medications and in therapy. He has severe depression (and anxiety I suspect), and has been in therapy before. Hes going back to therapy, but there were not any availabilities until August. He has a history of getting depressed in relationships (previous two gfs and me).He and I have similar histories. Both our families had pretty nasty divorces. Both of our mothers developed cancer while we were still young teenagers. Our families are in similar geographic regions. We both had a relationship that was emotionally abusive. I guess I mention these because it was easy for us to understand each other when we first met, but also because I think these could have impacted our mental developments and relationships.Both my partner and I are in graduate school. He has a major exam coming up that determines if he will qualify for candidacy. This exam has been looming for a while and has been pushed back a couple of times because of COVID, but also because he was not prioritizing preparing for it. This stressor is contributing to his depression.The other stressor is our relationship. Its been on the rocks for a couple of months now. He left to visit family in May and he was not in the mood to have sex when he came back. I miss the sexual intimacy, but I am much prefer physical affection and emotional intimacy. Having said that, its always been hard for him to open up to me. In June, he did something that really upset me at the time, which started his spiraling. I have since forgiven him, but I do not think hes forgiven himself. He admitted hes been depressed for a while now. I did not see the signs very well and attributed it to stress from his exam (before I knew our relationship was also stressing him out). He said a lot of self-hate things and started punching himself in the face. I called his dad and told him what is going on because I felt like I could not be his only support. we have been in limbo (how he described it) since June. We did not see each other much the first couple of weeks because we both needed space. After that, I have been the one initiating contact and hanging out to get a feel for things. we have been telling we love and miss each other still. However, he told me this weekend that the physical affection is hurting him and he was not comfortable with me going to our mutual friends because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. For 4th of July, he also did not act like my boyfriend.This really hurt me but I have been trying to listen to his needs more because of his depression. Hes asked for more space to focus on school, which also hurts but I do the same when I need to get work done. I have tried to get him into our schools counseling between now and his regular therapist, but he does not want to talk to a new therapist. I have also tried to get him to couples therapy. He said he would go, but its obvious he does not want to be there, so I have not scheduled anything because I do not think it would be productive if he does not want to be there. I have asked if I can help him around his house because he is not taking care of himself. I have asked how can I support him, which was the space mentioned above.He does not know what he wants in regards to us. I do not know if its the depression talking. Hes scared if we have an on and off relationship that I will eventually leave him for good because an ex did that. Hes thinks I am disappointed in him (I have never said this, he sets these expectations for himself) because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. I feel he does love me because 1) friends and his family have told me he loves and cares about me very much, 2) he showed it through his actions before all of this, 3) he told me he loves making me happy. But, my doubts have been creeping in. He said his depression is getting worse. He does not want to see me, I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I cannot tell him how this is affecting me without him spiraling, and I just feel like I keep hurting him when I am trying my best to help him. I cannot help but think his feelings for me have changed.I love him so much for so many reasons. I loved him early on in our relationship but I wanted to be sure it was real and not infatuation, so I did not say anything until maybe 9 months in. I wish he could see what I see. But him pushing me away is hurting me and affecting my mental health now.

"Feels kind of weird posting about this on Reddit, but if it helps then I might as well.I am 16 years old, depressed, and was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome at age 6, along with being tested for autism multiple times (none of them came back, and I am fairly certain I am not on the spectrum, or at least not noticeably) and Asperger's once. I had an abusive stepfather for about 9 years, from when I was 3 to when I was about 11-12. I have just finished my GCSEs, and I am waiting on my grades. I have always been a high achiever, always been placed on ""gifted and talented"" lists, always used to bury myself in science textbooks and documentaries. Back before I had access to the Internet, my education was almost a coping mechanism. Still, now it feels like a lot of other people deserve their academix success a damn sight more than I do. Compared to a lot of people on this subreddit, I should be incredibly lucky. But I do not think my luck can be much worse. I am in a friends with benefits type relationship with a girl that I have loved for about 2 years, and we still love each other, but I used to talk to her about all of my depression and suicidal tendencies and now we have got a strict rule that I cannot talk to her about it anymore. Which tbf is for the best. That does not mean it does not hurt though. I guess my main problem is that I feel isolated almost all the time. Even in a room of people I feel like I am alone. Sometimes even when I am with her. Back when I had that abusive stepfather, I remember sitting in my room, in a corner, too afraid to leave or even move until my mum came home. I have grown up since then, but on the inside that is still how I feel. I have gone through countless friend groups who do not give a shit about me, I have only ever found three or four ""real"" friends yet I feel awful telling them about anything I have experienced or I am feeling. I tried to tell my teachers that they were putting me under too much stress, and then they decide to tell my mum, when I asked them not to. Queue me being treated like an alien for weeks. I have written countless rants, suicide note drafts, sad monologues, and it is getting tiring. The suicidal stuff gets terrifying sometimes... I have a massive fear of death, but I do not want to keep on living in this kind of world. I am not always suicidal, and to be honest today has been a really good day for me. But it is not like that makes it go away. Sometimes I am scared of what is going to happen to me in X amount of years. In fact, that is pretty much all of the time. As I get older, I start to realise that my childhood is slowly slipping away from me, and that I should probably enjoy what is left of it as much as I can, yet... I do not think I have ever really enjoyed my childhood. I am going to stop there, since I would be here for days otherwise. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

I've gotten really close with him and I am so fuckin glad I befriended him. He's really loving, kind and patient. He's assertive, out there and also very protective while I'm very quiet, meek and also generally on edge and easily spooked so he balances me out and calms me very well.

I went to different school just so I can start again but it only made it worse enough for me to attempt suicide two times. High expectation of relatives became stress and pressure for me.

"I think I have bone cancer Im 20 years old (male) and im 6' 3"" 170 lbs

Let me start of by saying that for most of my life i think i have symptoms and i think im gonna die everytime untill i finally go to the doctor aand find out its some minor problem.

Ok so in spring of 2015 i noticed the muscle above my knee was twitching a lot so i got into the habit of feeling that area every day until i noticed a hard lump developing on my bone. I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.

Two years later (this last summer) i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painful/tender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.

Anyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.

My pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs  and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.

I usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds (in muscle) over the last 6 months.

What i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?

And for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town.

"This is kind of just ganna be a thought dump I guess, but its something I need to put somewhere so it is not festering in my head.I do not really understand myself anymore. I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, ""I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad"" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just 'in a mood'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that.

"I cannot help to feel sorry for feeling suicidal almost every day in the past 3 years. Every day I woke up, the PTSD kicks in and it will repeat my mistake vividly. It took so much of my energy just to combat that PTSD, let alone the suicidal thought. The flashback is so real, and often leaves me with an accelerated heartbeat and a wet pillow when I wake up.I am not sure if feeling suicidal is a sure sign of depression or not. But I know that in my calm mind, that whenever the PTSD or the memory flashback kicks in, I will start to plan for suicidal methods. How I wish I can enjoy a painless death.......I know, I am sick. But I lives in a very conservative society. Suicide is a taboo topic in here and nobody would really talk about that. As a man, I know I am ""not supposed to feeling suicidal"", as this will show that I am vulnerable. I know being vulnerable is a huge weakness in this market, everyone will hits your weak point to achieve maximum benefits. I know I cannot afford to be vulnerable. I know I live in the stereotype image. Today, because of pure coincidence, I am forced to work with someone that happens to be the main character in my PTSD. She was kind, never mentioned any of my past mistakes. but before she left, she say something to me in private. This caused my PTSD and suicidal thought to be in peak. But since I am working (as a videographer), I need to display a professional image. I cannot display my personal emotion in front of client.It was only until when I am back to home and finally be alone. I slump into the bed, feeling no appetite to eat. The thought to end my life was the strongest I ever encounter. The only motivation is to seek death, so I open up my laptop, searching for any new drug that can be purchased discreetly to end my life painlessly. You know, whenever you google up suicide, there will always be a hotline number. I doubt it actually works. They will eventually say that, ""in the end you still need to rely on yourself"". I am no stranger to a suicide thoughts, and I am getting tired to all these anti-suicide campaigns. I really doubt it is helpful, especially for someone likes me that could not talk properly about my mental issue. Today is not my first suicide attempt, and I doubt it will be the last suicide attempt in my life. The PTSD and suicide leave such a permanent disability in my mental capacity. Sometimes I wish I can be dead, and sometimes where I feel so lucky not to suicide at that point. I had been trapped into this ""tried to suicide, failed, glad I am not dead"" cycle. I feel so tired and drains out to combat with these negative thoughts. I had long lost the courage to lives on. I can only use new goals to excites myself. Quite similar in dark souls, once you finish your duty, you are bound to ""die"" (literally). I am really sorry for the negativity. I am so scared to talk about this with anyone. This had been my deepest secret that I could not share with anyone. I felt really guilty that while I am feeling suicidal, there are thousands of people in the hospital who struggle to live on. How I wish I can ""transfer"" my lifespan to them..... They can just live on with my life, while I die (happily, I hope so).

I have a lot of codIm 29 going on 30, and I have a lot of issues. I have no contact with my family (my dad died in a car accident, and my grandmother of cancer. Both within a month of eachother. The rest of my family are assholes), two of my closest friends stopped talking to me because of my mental health, I am paying for an apartment I cannot afford, and I graduated recently with a degree in art where tbh, I am mediocre at best. Right now, I am waiting tables and having to fake all of my emotions every fucking day and really sell that I care about someone is lunch taking too long. I feel like I cannot really make art, or even enjoy making art, because my depression has gotten so bad. Its been so hard to motivate, and I feel like a fucking loser. I am barely sleeping. I work, I go home, I lay on the couch till the sun goes down. At this point, I cannot even listen to music or watch tv anymore because the anxiety of feeling like a worthless pos kicks in, so most of the time I just lay here and do nothing. I am really self conscious about where I am, I feel stuck, and I do not know how to get out of the hole I am in.I drink alone now. I did not even drink until about two years ago. Honestly, I do not even really like alcohol that much, it just makes the time go by and makes me not want to eat. I am uncomfortable in my body and have always wanted to be skinny and pretty, and never have been either of those things.So I stupidly and drunkenly called him, and asked what it was exactly that made him change his mind about me. He basically validated everything that I have been feeling; that I have no drive, no motivation, and that I have just gotten comfortable. I do not know why I did it, but I told him I had to go, grabbed an xacto, and cut my leg. I had to call out of work for two days because the wound was not really healing, and I did not want to go to the hospital because I am uninsured and afraid of being put on a psychiatric hold. I already have so much fucking debt. I went to work today, but it was really hard and I was in a lot of pain.I do not know what to do with myself.

"I'm so tired of trying to be okay. When I don't exercise regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to go into social settings and interact with others, especially friends, semi-regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to switch up my routine, it happens and it happens when I have no routine. It happens when I don't get enough sleep, when I don't spend enough time outside and the list goes on. It's exhausting. And while a lot of these habits/things are enjoyable in the moment, once I push past my ""but I don't wanna"" inner toddler brain, I'm so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain ""okay"".And truth be told, lately, I haven't.

"My [31] BF[36] of 1.5 year is generally quite a charismatic and positive person. He jokes around and can be absolutely charming. If you talked to him as a stranger you would never think he may be depressed, but I am starting to get seconds thoughts, and its breaking my heart.He grew up in a rich family with a lot of staff who helped the family with the house, and went to an expensive private school. Also he was the youngest sibling in his family, so he enjoyed a careless childhood.Then he studied, worked some years very successfully, met me. He had some relationships with women before me, but they were always somewhat traumatic or abusive. Now - i think - we have a very caring relationship. He has a very strong charismatic personality, he is manly, talented, very empathetic and smart. we have met about 1.5 years ago. For all this time till now his working hours were cut down due to corona, and he worked only 3 days a week from home, so he had a lot of free time. And besides working he has done all the same things for 1.5 years. He smokes, reads social media, watches series (most of them hes seen before), eats. He has insomnia. He often wakes up tired in the morning. His work is frustrating for him, but he seems to feel insecure to search for another job. Recently when i jokingly said something about an old psychological trauma of mine, he answered seriously: and my trauma was having to go to work 5 days a week. And the puzzle got together in my head today. I think that as kind in a rich family he never was taucht the concept of labor of any kind, and work is actually something really unpleasant for him. His current job is especially boring and feels unnecessary. So he never really accepted that he has to go to work, its actually a trauma, and he dreads it all the time. When he learned that he has to work 5 days again, he was glum and grumpy for a whole week. I really wish he would get therapy on the matter. But I am afraid that he would think its a sign of weakness, and that the world just works this way. That everyone has his job that much... But i disagree! I feel that something is dreading and exhausting him all the time! and i think its fear that he has to work, and he will have to do it for many more years. I love him.

I work in an urgent care and I got reprimanded. The first one was when I found a woman bleeding on the ground right outside the clinic and I went inside to get help because I could not lift her by myself. I told the PA and everyone pretty much rushed outside except me and one other person because I just got there and had to put my stuff down. But they think I completely ignored the patient and walked by them when I was the one who found her and got help. The reason I did not go with them was because someone had to keep seeing the patients. They were backed up already and there were 5 people already going outside to help her that it would have made no sense for me to go with them. They did not even try to clear things up with me. They just assumed that I did not want to help and told my supervisor which is bullshit. They think I am horrible because of a misunderstanding. And then I messed up by not putting the patient in the bed when putting an IV in. They fainted and started convulsing which could have hurt them badly if they hit their head. I know I screwed up big time and I just cannot get over it. I was going to go part time once school started in fall. But now I think I should just quit.

 and in German I've never had any problems with grammar and such and commas and everything just happened by itself and I always wrote a 1 in dictations and now all of a sudden I've made all these grammatical errors that I've made before and still messed them up.
 and I've never had problems remembering things, but now on a ö I can't remember anything anymore.  I forget everything I'm told and I always have to imagine it before I'm told things.

People see someone on tv or wherever doing it and recognize that these kind of actions/tropes communicateIm desperate/I need help and then replicate them to communicate this message to their environment. I think this kind of blurs the line between really suicidal people/people who harm themselves as symptoms of an mental illness and the ones who are just asking for help.

"Hey everyone. I am 14, and all my life I have struggled with anxiety, OCD, and in the past 2 years I have really started to struggle with a depressive disorder. My plan is to ask a doctor about bipolar disorder this year. I have lost so many friends. So many friends. I lost the best girlfriend I could have ever asked for. I feel like a failure and that life is just over. I wake up crying, I cry every night. I am constantly stressed over so much. I cannot be happy for more then 15 minutes.

"I am going to tell you that my mom and as dad are the best parents that a man like me could ever ask for and I am sorry for ending my life short. This is not a reflection on you or your parenting but just a reflection on how I see the world as it is right now and I do not like it. I see so much misery and pain. So much fog and I do not see anything in my way. You have given me so much but I feel like I am not worthy on this planet. I want to see Koda again. My best friend who still after 2 years after we had to put her down I cry and think about her. I want you to know I made a melody for her on my guitar and I played for her less than a day that she died. She must have loved it because I gave my all when I played it and I want to play it for her one more time and I want to know how she feels about it. A man's best friend is his dog, if he has nobody else and that was my girl, Koda! No animal has ever made me feel stupid and my friends have made me feel smart. Jack is my boy and I have always wanted him to be happy and the only task that I will give you is to honor him as my angel. Feed him honorably. Pet him and scratch his tummy. Give him regular walks. Bath him regularly. Love him 24/7. Please be patient with him. do not hit or yell. Please play with him!!!!To my lovely sisters I want you to know that I cherish the lovely days when we were kids. Playing Nintendo 64 together and watching you play meant the world to me and it still does. I have tried reconciling that joy thorough watching people stream but it has never brought up the memory of when we were little. Thank you for helping me and mothering me when I needed it the most. I will never forget the times when we huddled up crying and embracing each other while our parents fought. It did not scar me but I hate to remember those times when our parents hurled insults back at each other. Money now seems like such a waste. But anyways I want you to know that I care for you so much. I would do anything to make you feel safe. I am the baby of the family and have always felt like the black sheep. A gay man who was curse with fantasizing. My head can never shut up and I am fed up with it. No meds or therapy can take away the pain. Life is just a void of work and misery till you die. I could have a billion dollars in the bank but I know I would just be drinking eating and smoking till my inevitable passing. Die now in my prime or die after years of mental torture. I truly do not see another side to this. A final note id like to make is to my nephew Bryce. I want you to know sweety is that I have always loved you and care for you deeply. I missed those days when you under a year old and I was feeding, burping, bathing and changing you. I greatest moment ill never forget is when you had a big accident and poop was all over my arms but I want grossed out. I knew that was most important was to make sure you were safe and clean. I will never forget when I was giving you a bath in the sink and I turned to grab a rag on the floor and turn to see you peeing a fountain in the water and making eye contact with me and giggling. that is when I knew you were a special child with a great personality. Such a boy like your mother. I hope that you turn into a Warrior and not let anyone step in your way. You fight like a champion but you never throw the first fist or hurl the first insult. You are better than that. You be respectful and kill your enemies with kindness. Then ditch them to rot in the filth that is not towards you. Walk away.I love you all. Please cre mate me and throw my ashes with Koda in the ocean so we can be at peace together. I am getting lost in my hopes and dreams, I cannot see far, but I know I can see, Everything is a blur to me, But I am hoping for some visibility, I thank my God for all I have,that is why I am going to die noble, In not going to die sav,I know I need to grow up,I know I need to learn, But I feel that all of my fears, Will leave me 3rd degree burned.

"One spot on my spine feels tender, I'm worried it's cancer. I haven't been worried about my health for a while so this didn't concern me much until today.  I notice that when I hunch over, or when I press on this particular spot on my back (near where my bra strap would be) it feels like I bruised it.  It's not painful enough to disrupt my day, but it's a little disconcerting.  I started googling and I saw a bunch of people who had this and it just went away on its own or it wasn't anything, but then of course I continued googling and ""back pain"" can be cancer.  It's surface-level though, really does just feel like a skin bruise.  And I don't feel it at all if I sit normally and don't press on it.

"I have a rabies fear, can anyone help out? This all started last June, I was playing with my dog in my yard. He lunges forward and I reached out with my hand and his tooth scraped my middle finger. It did cut the skin and I was bleeding. My finger was tingling at the site where he bit me. I went to go wash it off and didn’t think much of it until I looked on the fridge and I see my dog was a week overdue on his rabies vaccine. I panicked and wasn’t sure what I should do. I know of rabies, but I didn’t KNOW rabies until my dumb mind did some googling. 

If you know where the googling is going, then you understand my fear. If you don’t, just don’t worry about it. 

My dog at the time is a 13 year old German Shepherd. He is prone to seizures and would have a couple of them a year. We’ve had him for 11 years so we know how to handle the situation. He also drooled and foamed a lot in the mouth. That was his natural way. He’s been vaccinated every year as it is required in the state of New Mexico. 

I did go to urgent care and received a Tetanus shot since I was overdue on that one but my doctor told me that it’s been over 40 years since a dog had rabies in my area. so I did not receive the rabies shots. Which made me feel better honestly. For about 5 months. 

In October, my dog was put down because he was struggling to stand up and seemed like he was in pain a lot. 

In late November, I got what seemed like a week long cold. Sore throat, tired, drained and all that junk. I was sick but not terrible so I went to a concert and I started to feel worse. For some dumb reason, the first thing that appeared in my mind was rabies. And I almost panicked because of it and couldn’t enjoy the show. I went home after feeling very horrible. I couldn’t sleep, a headache kicked in, my fever rose and it’s like my mind was repeating the same scene over and over all night long and I couldn’t sleep at all. Then I woke up around 5 am with a racing heartbeat that wouldn’t slow down at all. I felt awful and was fearful about rabies. 

Since that day, I never ignored my finger where my dog bit me. I still feel pain and a minor tingling sensation where he bit me and all I can think about is if I have rabies. It’s practically on a daily basis I look at the spot. I have no idea how to get past this. It’s been 9 months since the incident and I still worry about getting it. I just can’t shake this fear out of my mind. I thought the spot where he bit me would be gone but the area is still red as if it’s been only a couple of weeks since he’s bitten me. 

I’ve tried everything, such as logic. It’s exceedingly rare in the US, most rabies cases have been from bats in the US or contracted outside. Last person to die from a dog rabies in the US was in 1974. Basically when my parents were still kids. And I’m 25 now. My dog survived the 10 day quarantine and we vaccinated him after those 10 days just in case. 

Like I can’t shake the fear. Each time my finger is in pain or even get a tingling sensation, my mind instantly jumps to that conclusion. I almost don’t care about anything else. I have stomach pains and I’m going to see a gastroenterologist about it, I really wouldn’t care if they told me I had cancer. Rabies is just something that truly sparks fear in my mind. 

I even freak out seeing bats in the sky since I work at stadiums as a camera guy. ",Anxiety,"{""category"": ""Anxiety""}",2025-04-21 01:31:08.947092,e5-large-v2

"Definitely depression, but could there be something else too? (Thanks in advance!) I'm in my early 20's, currently a full-time student, currently seeing a counselor at my university for the depression I had from October-early February.

Some background: *Had an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive father growing up

*had cycles of depression as a teen but nothing as bad as this past fall, never before gotten treatment for it.

*used to have anger issues that I've been working on and have mostly gotten better.

*I used to be and still have worries in the back of my mind about some new super bug plague wiping out humanity, apocalyptic scenarios (before dystopian books were a thing-- or at least before it was on my radar), generally was and am irritable at times (can't stand foot/leg bouncers/tappers and gum smacking--as a result I feel pretty trapped in lecture halls). Something that also seems to stand out to me is that a year or two ago I got uncontrollably angry (literally shaking mad) at my roommate for no reason and had to go on a really long walk.

Currently: During my depressed period I had foggy cotton ball brain, couldn't concentrate, trouble sleeping and staying asleep, the irritability, suicidal thoughts all the time, racing thoughts.

Early last week I kinda started feeling better, one day everything looked more vivid. That sounds weird, but color had a touch more color, bright things were more bright. The next day I was so elated and have been ecstatic each morning. Waking up has been easy for the first time in a long time. I'm not riddled with self doubt or constantly wondering if I'm annoying people by talking to them. I'm actually excited for my future. I got cheap new clothes that fit so I don't have to wear my sweatpants every day any more.

Today I woke up early, did a bunch of errands, got more clothes, ran for the first time since September, did my usual short workout routine twice, and even went to an event at my university.

It's nice to finally be happy, but it feels wrong to be THIS happy so suddenly after having suicidal thoughts all day every day.

I meant to talk to my counselor about all this this morning but she was out sick---so instead I am asking for any personal experience or thoughts on this to see if I might be way off base or not here. ",Bipolar,"{""category"": ""Bipolar""}",2025-04-21 01:31:38.354474,e5-large-v2

"Really need help here, I have struggled with feeling this way for weeks now.For the past month or so I have had little to no motivation to do anything anymore. Even writing this post requires a tremendous amount of effort. I have plenty of things to do, but I just have no desire or motivation to do anything. Going to the gym, working out, studying, learning a new skill, cooking and eating, it all just feels boring and dull to me. Some days I will force myself to go to the gym but I end up leaving because there is no energy/motivation to get through a workout. Nothing is enjoyable, besides video games and porn, but even those two things are getting really boring and do not provide me with the same amount of satisfaction any longer.I finally figured out that a large part of this problem stems from how lonely I am. I am 35 and I live with my parents. I left my job in the military because I could not take it anymore and wanted to earn my bachelors degree. I moved back in with my parents because of the pandemic, although I will return to school in the fall. I HATE living with my father, who is even more depressed/lonely/pathetic/miserable than I am. he is an incredibly toxic person to be around, and I know once I am gone and away from him I will begin to feel better.I do not know anyone where I live. I have absolutely no friends. I looked for groups to join on [meetup.com]( but nothing really interests me. Besides, going to clubs like that just seems so strange to me. I have never had a girlfriend and never had sex. I am a good looking guy who is in great shape, but I think years of watching pornography online has really harmed/damaged my brain in some way. I have incredibly high expectations in women. I am trying to stop watching porn, but it is the only thing in my life that I enjoy and look forward to. That really hurt me to say that, but sadly it is true.The worst part about this entire situation is the amount of time I am wasting sitting here doing nothing all day. I have plenty of things I could be doing, but NOTHING interests me anymore.

Most of my stressors will leave me when the move itself happens and I'm seeing a new therapist as well then, one better equipped to help me.

I just need help with eating in the meantime. I can barely stomach anything, when I do try eat a meal, I'm done after a few bites. I have very little control at the moment and I want to do right to my body to reduce the impact of this stress. All I can really control are food, making sure I take my medication and get some extra sleep. I just need help or advice with the food part.

"I feel so empty and don't know who I am I don't think I know what I'm looking for here. Maybe just a place where I can spew how I'm feeling out without being afraid of creating some kind of judgment or conflict. 

I have been having a growing identity crisis lately. Once I was diagnosed, my life was based around understanding my illness. Then it was about treating it. Then it became about  maintaining it. Now that I've been maintaining it for nearly two years, I feel like I've completely lost myself in the process. 

I am on disability so don't work, live in a rural town so don't have a big social circle, and I used to get into a lot of different artsy projects, but since getting on my current med cocktail that actually seems to work, I've lost all drive and desire to be creative. I even pulled my art bag out in the hopes that I would want to pick things up and get messy...but nothing. I ended up putting it behind the end table in my living room so it is out of the way. 

I spend my days exercising, taking care of my dog, cat and husband, my house, cooking and watching tv/movies. And while I am a genuine cinephile - it's not enough; I feel so empty. Nothing about my life feels worth while anymore. I can't tell my husband before I sort this feeling out because he'll take it personally and I cannot handle that kind of conflict right now. 


I literally cried myself to sleep last night (though that was provoked because right now my husband is sick with an infection for over a week and he can get a little brash when he doesn't feel well...I try not to take it personally, because it's not personal, it just can hit the right/wrong buttons). When I was showering today I was listening to music, and the song ""Try"" came on, and when Colbie Caillat sang ""You don't have to try so hard"" I just lost it. There was no trigger this time except the song. 

I've always really been interested in and invested in politics, but the way that politics have been for the last two years, I just feel like it is adding this constant weight to my heart. I am so so sad to see what has happened to our country. Everything feels like it's getting worse and I can't see the good happening in the world, anymore. So that hobby has become a very heavy emotional weight.

I mean BLATANT favoritism parents divorced within those 3 years. parents stole me from each other, back and forth until Social Services stepped in first foster home gave me a short glimpse of what it was like to be cared for in the first time of my 8 years of life ended up being taken out of that home after about 6 months and put into a new one new foster mother beats me regularly, sexually abused me frequently and to top it off, keeps me locked up in a basement room with no windows, no clocks, no way to tell time. Leaving me in there for days at a time. This was frequently done over a 5 year period of my life after 5 years had passed, my father got custody of me only to treat me like a ghost. He only got me back for the SSI check. Other than that, I did not exist to him pretty much in school, I was teased a lot because I was constantly in sweats, I did not have any real clothing other than that and laundry was not done on any regular basis. Their laundry was, mine was not. already extremely socially isolated, things progressively got worse up to the point of someone physically bullying me and eventually I snapped and put him in the hospital. Made me realize what a monster I was. during the last couple years of high school, I found my high school sweetheart. We were together for 7 years. We made a son together. he is currently 17, turning 18 later this year. social services got involved in my life again claiming we had failed to get our son his shots, which we had to reschedule because her grandmother had passed on the day before the scheduled shots. So there goes a year and a half of fighting the incessant demands of social services they get into her head. Tell her she does not need me. She leaves me, takes me to court for 100% custody. At that point, I did not think I could possibly be more broken. I did not have a choice, so I just gave up and within 2 months, she had taken my son to another state to pursue some internet boyfriend she met on some backwards art site D something or another. a couple years pass and I decide to try again with someone new. Started off strong but there were a ton of issues and a lot of damage left behind from my past relationship. I could never trust her. still, she got pregnant on our second time so she had not gotten a chance to see the extent of the damage in me. I wish I could have been able to tell her to just run, run away from me. I suppose in some way, I did just not in so many words. towards the end our son was delivered as a stillborn. His umbilical cord had wrapped around his neck, killing him days before he was due. Just a few days. we split ways after this. I took the loss personally, as though it was God's way of punishing me for being the monster I was. Got super suicidal and tried dozens of times to end myself. All failed, obviously. a few more years passed after and I was still stuck on this notion that I wanted a family. So naturally, I found a new relationship and moved clear across the country just to be with her. while we were in person together, things were amazing. It was like gravity, we could not stay away from each other. But when the time came to part ways... that is when things got ugly, fast. still, we managed to make it last for nearly 5 years and she bore me another son. I wanted to be there so badly and she knew I did. We had talked about several times. I got to see my son ONCE before she decided she was going to keep him from me. Even despite the fact she knew I was going to be a good father. First her, it was just easier to not have to fight her grandparents who she lived with. So that is what she did. He was born nearly 7 years ago and I have not seen him since the day he was born. after two years of fighting with her to just be a family with me, I finally broke in the worst way I have ever broken in my life. I just gave up. She was not going to change her mind ever. So I walked away. more suicide attempts and a few months later I decided a drastic change was needed inside me. So that is what I did. I pursued self actualization and personal development and started to try to deal with all thus trauma I had experienced in this life. something clicked inside, like a burner just turned on and suddenly I started thinking differently, I became different than who I was before. The original owner of this vessel was gone and I was born. I was ready to accept that I would never have my own family, but I was not ready to give up on love so I went and found a new relationship. This one was actually pretty good. I did not accuse her of cheating ever in our entire relationship. I gave her room to do her own stuff and encouraged her to take time with her son, her friends, her family. I was being a good partner for once in my life and I was open to her, open to the idea this could last, it honestly felt like it was my forever home. I let myself actually believe in that. as you may suspect, things eventually fell apart. She pulled away from me, stopped so much as even touching me and I tried to talk with her, communicate what was going on to no avail. The day we broke up, she had gone away for 5 days saying she was babysitting her sister-in-law's dog. Well, I found out that that whole story was a lie, just from a Facebook post of her sister-in-law at home with her two children, getting ready for the weekend. in the end she said it was because I was too sensitive and too difficult to love. Those words still stick with me almost 2 years later now. at this point I am completely lost about what I want anymore. I want to have that relationship that lasts but I am not sure I can trust myself to actually even try again. So what else is there for me? I could never have my family, cannot even have a secure relationship even when I have worked so hard to be acceptable and lovable. I cannot help but feel like I am just wasting time, wasting my therapist's time all in some delusion that I will ever be worthy of love.&amp;#x200B;that is just a chunk of my iceberg. The super short, short version. I suppose that is why it is so hard for me to believe that anyone could even comprehend the things I have been through. The bottom is not where you think it is.

"Anxiety Over Having Made No Accomplishments in Life I'm almost 40 so my life is nearly half over and I feel like I've done nothing with it. Especially because for some stupid reason I've placed all my eggs in one basket and insisted on becoming a successful author no matter how stupid or hard or impossible it is to do that these days. I haven't even tried to date anyone in over 10 years so though I'd like a relationship, I'm socially inept and awkward. I also have a lot of baggage not just from an abusive father but from two abusive relationships I was stupid enough to get into. At my age with my history, no one wants to even attempt to deal with that nonsense and as I said I'm inept at socializing because of my own problems. I don't have a ""career"" like my siblings. I don't have a family. I don't even have a job because of a permanent disability making it almost impossible for me to work. Though I have written several novels, they more than likely will never see anything resembling profit or commercial success. Most of my days are spent playing video games, hating my life, and writing because I'm too stubborn to give up on that dream despite every single sign telling me that I'm old, it's over, and there's no way I'm talented enough to make it work. 

I know that people will say that I shouldn't measure my success by other people or people around me but let me tell you. It's exceedingly hard to show up to family functions when all your siblings are married professionals with their own houses and you are the loser who has been single for 15 years because she can't manage to get into a relationship that's not abusive and would prefer to stay at home, alone with her cat who's gonna die soon anyway because he's old. If you want to suggest therapy or medication...I've done both. Medication isn't a fix for me and I've tried it on and off for years. Therapy has been a constant in my life since I was 18 so if you can possibly imagine it I was far worse than \*this\* before now. If anything I could \*possibly\* say it's a miracle that I've come as far as I have with recovering from abuse, dealing with addiction, an eating disorder, and my anxiety issues. Yet, at the same time, I desire things that I'm 99% sure I can never have and I know I'm running out of time.

"I am going to share with you something that has always cheered me up and calmed me down whenever I get really anxious over my health So this sub only seems to really have posts from users describing their symptoms and trying to get diagnosed on Reddit, now if that helps you with your anxiety that's cool, however it can be counter intuitive as the whole googling and obsessing over symptoms is the actual problem we all came here to rid ourselves in the first place. So I honestly do believe we should move more away from ""I have x,y,z symptoms am I going to die?"" to ""How can I find peace of mind and stop googling"" 


One thing I do to get peace of mind is watch this episode of [Hey Arnold](https://www.wco.tv/hey-arnold-season-2-episode-5-monkey-business-2) which is my all time favourite show (it's only the first episode in the video provided called 'monkey business' btw), I won't ruin it for you all, but it's really funny and will hit home for all of us, it highlights how silly we can be sometimes when we think we have a really bad illness and start obsessing over symptoms.

We were of the same mind. Good in theory, but no real science to support their claims. With MDD and PTST sure, but bipolar is a different kind of beast.

Also insurance doesn't cover it so it would all be out of pocket. I am a prime candidate, but I'm not going to pay money to be a lab rat, especially if there's a 20% failure rate.

"I recovered from AvPD. What will help others? I don’t believe in matters of mental health ever truly being 100% cured.

Even though I still have some AvPD traits that I’m still working on, my therapist says I certainly no longer meet the diagnosis of AvPD.

I’ve gone from being a textbook AvPD with such bad social anxiety I barely left the house an could barely order a cheeseburger.
All through school people called me “socially retarded” and my mom thought I was autistic.
To now being a very socially skilled, confident, outgoing person who makes friends easily.

I’m curious if people are interested in some kind of a write up about how I’ve recovered from my AvPD, what helped me, how long it can take etc?

I see a lot of people struggling and feeling hopeless on this board.
It breaks my heart when I see people truly believe that recovery is impossible (and spreading that false message). It is possible! It’s just really hard, uncomfortable, takes a lot of time and you have to really want it.

Thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of? I’m also open to suggestions of what else could help.

"Anyone else lose the ability to have emotions and feelings as physical sensations in the body? All sensations of feeling and emotion is gone from my body. I dont Feel numb, i Feel dead.

My brain also feels non-responsive and i am only on autopilot.

My body feels like stone. Too light. Nothing dragging it down causing a heavy feeling making it be my own. My arms feels so strange. It feels like I am not in my body. It is so mechanical. 

I dont sleep because i dont Feel sleepy. I never Feel calm in my body, just an unnerving neutral and restless feeling.

I want to Feel, but there is nothing in my body. When i am sad and angry i just know, because there is nothing in my body. No surge of rage and no pain in my chest. 

When i lay down under my covers, i dont get a familiar calm and warm, heavy feeling in my body. It is still hard as stone on the inside.

Also i dont Feel hunger. And never sleepy in my head. I also dont Feel confused in my head or get a foggy feeling. Even though i know that is what i am. 

I also never get a feeling associated with a place or memory. When i think of a memory i get no spontanious emotion connected to it. 

Like sitting on the terrace with a nice cup of tee, early morning walks, sitting down on the couch after a hard day of work. Never get these feelings in my body. Also the feelifn of autimn, friday, christmas. All gone. Cant even remember them in my mind because i cant Feel with my brain. 

All emotions are purely mental. Sometimes my brain is so numb though it does not respond to any stimulus. And i have this constant unsatisfactory feeling because nothing makes me Feel.

All i have left is stress in my body. Nothing else. This bad restlessness i cant get out of.

"not sure about what to do with my life. For the past 4 years I've (18m) struggled with depression, I guess it started with the very turbulent divorce of my parents (a violent fuckfest) when I was 14yo in 2019, it was at that time that I started doing drugs such as mdma, lsd and cocaine, however I'd say my drug consumption really started as young as 12 given that I would abuse my adhd medication (ritalin) by snorting it.
Later down that year I had some pretty shitty moments with my mother (physical violence) as my father abandoned us to go live in another country for half the year, when he came back, they found out about my drug usage, which again ended up in physical abuse and the over infantilization of a 15 yo boy who never had any freedom or power in his life, my parents started walking me to school (it was 2 blocks away from home lmao), once they even punched me infront of my classmates and threatened some random boy about beating him up because they confused him with someone I smoked weed with.
At the end of that year they sent me to love with my grandma in another country.
There I was, all alone in a country that was foreign to me although I was born there, I had family of course, but I can't really be myself around my family, the year was 2020 and I was just starting classes again when the pandemic hit, it was at that point when I abandoned my studies for the first time, tbh I didn't suffer through covid because I lived with my cousin and we played videogames all day, but I ended up drinking a ton of alcohol in secret again, sniffing gas from the stove, stealing pills from my grandma, because I was desperate, life felt like it physically weighted on me,
I stopped eating because sadness did not allow me to, I started getting weaker and weaker untill 10onths later my mother picked me up and we returned to tje country I was raised in.
It did not get better for a long time.
My mother did not trust me at all and didn't allow me to go outside (I was 16 at the time), she even hid the keys from me.
As I realized that she would never trust me again I said fuck it and started smoking weed again, yadda yadda I start studying again and pass the year (yay), but still, I was a 17yo boy who isolated himself for 2 years and didn't talk irl to anyone that wasn't family, I developed a serious internet addiction due to it.
In 2022 stuff got slightly better, but not really, during summer break I met a girl (26yo) online, and we start talking, we like each other, the first time I left my house in years for something that wasn't school was to meet her, which I did, at the cemetery, I was 17.
Later in that year I get into an altercation with my mother and she beats me again and kicked me out of her house, after that I live with my father for a couple weeks before she decided to ask me to come back home again (she never said sorry), I get even more depressive to the point I abandon my studies again.
Then I become 18 years old, and this 26yo girl I talked about before asks to unvirgin me (to which I said yes), she invited me to her brother's bday party.
When everyone went to sleep, we were in bed together, I was sleepy and high, and she was drunk and coked tf up, we had a very awkward kiss, I then say that I forgot to bring condoms and she mounts me anyway before I could say anything.
After that shitty experience we become a couple, my first girlfriend ever yay.
Fuck it was a rollercoaster of shit, she was abusive, she offered me coke after I was clean for 3 years, she insulted me and said I was only useful for sex, she even slapped me a couple of times.
Why does everyone abuses me?
Now, 2023, I have my first job, but I still struggle with my weight, which makes me very self aware of how weak and small I am.. I feel ugly, I feel emasculated.
Now I have to study again and I just can't keep up with study and work (my work shift goes from 4am to 12pm, and my classes go from 6pm to 12am)
I just want to give up, I feel like I don't deserve anything, I just want to sleep and sleep and wake up when everything's allright.

"4 years ago I wasnt showering for months at a time, depressed, anxious and paranoid. At the time I was sober going on 18, 19 years. I was, and am on disability since 09' for schizoaffective bipolar type disorder. 

For the longest time, especially since sobriety, I've been overwhelmed with thinking. Space, time, behavior, tornadoes...whatever. 

But, since my life was an unmanaged train wreck I had no confidence in myself as having any quality. It seems that feeling good about yourself comes from a well managed life.   


My last job was as a janitor on the army base near by roughly 5 years ago. I couldnt handle the pressure. I was so dependant on others for everything I was asking if I was sweeping properly. Very bad mindset. A lady mentioned crying and it made me feel like crying. I didnt understand how that could be. It seemed like witchcraft, so to speak. That was my last day at my last job. It was my 4th attempt to go back to work since my disability badge acquisition! 

I've been in therapy for 16 or 17 years ago I got into therapy from a mental health episode. During that visit at the crisis stabilisation unit in Virginia (Fredricksburg) I met a man that changed my life. He went by the name Bose Uncle. He taught me a breathing exercise. 3 in 6 out. You breath in deep for 3 seconds roughly then out for 6 seconds. Also roughly. Dont try to be specific like me and do it exactly 3 and 6. 

On down the road, life and me under pressure and practicing my breathing because sufferage bleep blop bloop, pandemic. Overwhelming, unadulteraded pain in the brain from an anxiety I'd never expierenced before I saw a vision. It seemed to be the exact same thing that happened to Bill Wilson from AA. A wind blew through me. His words. My words on it are, I was no longer a bound up point in time and space holding on to the memories from the stimulation from the moment. I was free from the tension that came about from the fucking utter bullshit that exists. I let it go. The moment. I stopped holding and figuring. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was like my being afraid got wore out. I remember specifiaclly saying to myself at the height of my pain in a ridgid bodily posture laying in my recline, ""bullshit."" I calle dbullshit on my old beliefs. That old fire and brimstone god. Intstead I chose ""my concept"" of life as my God. My ideas are good to. Changed life.   


About six months later I nearly died from pancreatitis. When I got home from 6 days in the hospital I shared it on facebook. I received a good number of get well soon messages as expected. I did not get what I thought I would. People coming to visit, bringing me food...all that. I nearly fucking died. I know hundreds of people. What does that mean? My perception is fucked up, my beghhvior is fucked up, I need to change.   


I did not think that way at first. At first I thought, ""I fucking hate everyone."" For a while. 

Then 6 months later, I got diagnosed with autism. April 24th 2021.   


6 months later after learning to relax, I rested on my heels for the first time in my life. This began the second chapter of my life. The taking my time portion. The I am the most impotant person in my life to me. You all come second. For ever. I no longer run to the kitchen, the bathroom, through the grocery store, drive fast, or move my limbs fast. I have even taken control of my eyes speed of movement.   


Did you know that your body can control your mind. If you dont control your body your body will be controlled by your environment throught the mind.   


You receive stimulus simply due to being a sensing being. This moves you. If you are not aware of it. Make yourself aware of this and take control of your body, the way you look, smell, move (behavior speed) amplitude of voice ...total bodily control and you can eliminate a great deal of your own suffering. I havew come off my depression meds and greatfully have finally been more aptly medicated with litium. Now I dont have to force myself into slow mo behavior but I do stay aware I think from a bit of fear.   


You can control your thinking!

"Delusional neighborsHi everyone, I live in LA and my neighbors like to talk outside in the hall of the apartment complex. Btw I live in the projects (talking to them nicely is not going to be a solution.)Do not know much about them since they live across the hall. All I know is that there are adults (let us call them the red neighbors) in their thirties or older, do not work and I think they live off food stamps like a lot of people in the projects. There are a total of 5 women possibly not sure. Most of their time they spend talking outside their apartment door, hallway, or staircase. My apartment is less than 20 feet from the staircase so I guess they can hear when I am doing my chores. Lately, I noticed that they have been giving me stares when I see them outside. They used to talk to me before when I moved in years ago ""hi neighbor, how are you?"" when they would see me but shortly after that we stopped. No reason at all and well I do not mind because I have social anxiety so it is hard for me to speak to strangers even if they are my neighbors. So I might come off as shady to people but I am a no-one so why should someone care right? Anyways I also noticed that they have been talking ""quiter"" when I start cooking, or doing laundry, or washing my dishes but I feel like my neighbors think I am nosy and eavesdropping. They have not said anything to me directly but I have heard them say ""stop pretending your cooking"" or sometimes mentioning my apartment number. I am not sure if they were saying this subtle comment directly to me or whatnot but I am always listening to music with my earbuds on so maybe it is in my head.update: I wrote the top part a couple of days ago and left it as a draft bc I did not know what else to write but here is an update on this situation. they asked me when they found me in the lobby. ""I know you are listening to our conversations. do not act stupid. you pretend to cook so you can listen to what we are saying. "" me: ""I have never listened to any of your conversations nor does it interest me. I am often hearing music on my earbuds when I do my chorers. but if you do not like people listening in to your daily convos then I suggest talking outside of the building or in your own apartment"" neighbors: ""I know you are fucking lying. if you continue to do this ill fuck you up!"" I was taken aback by this ""confrontation"" bc I am allowed to do my chores at any time of day. just bc they are out there talking does not mean I should stop and not do it at all until they leave. So I am a bit shaken up since I have anxiety I am getting very nervous. I do know that they were not bluffing when it came down to fighting me. like I mentioned I live in the projects and it is not the nicest place to live nor are people nice here. I can not move out since I have not finished school nor do I have a full-time job. Can anyone help me with how I should go about it??? I am freaking out. i live with other family members and I am scared they might harm them too. we are on the skinny and petite side while they are tall and big so we are at a disadvantage here. I just cannot wrap my head around the reason why they are mad at me. do they feel entitled and why? are they on drugs that it has damaged how they think? Or are other neighbors on my floor talking shit about me to them? I once heard another neighbor (orange neighbor) who I have never talked to but I know his voice since he likes to join them in the hallway. Well, he referred to me as the Spanish female and he kept on repeating my apartment number. To this day I have no idea why. I know this because he was yelling at this point. that another neighbor (pink neighbor) had to come out and calm him down (btw pink, orange, and red neighbors know each other. I think they grew up in the same building since they were children. Also, all the neighbors are thirty or beyond since they have kids) Another instance was that the red neighbors were fighting outside in the hall that pink neighbors stepped in and said to lower the volume bc ""Spanish girl"" is listening. Tf why would I be listening plus I am not the only person living on the floor there are other families and they are being loud enough for everyone to hear. Mind you I was nowhere doing chores but in my bedroom and they were loud enough for me to hear. I just do not get why they are picking on me and I am the Spanish girl since I am the only Spanish on my floor. Why would Pink neighbors say that? Could it be bc they hold a grudge against me? Before COVID pink neighbor's kids used to play in the hall and their kids intentionally would hit my door with a basketball and kick it while laughing. I confronted them and never apologized instead they acted as If I was the villain. Btw all of these neighbors also do not work is that why they are so interested in me since they have nothing else to do??? I start working soon in person again so hopefully, I do not run on them but that is probably a lie since they stay at home all the time. I just do not understand what is it about me that they feel like they could bully me. I have been bullied before so this brings back memories and makes me feel like shit. If anyone could suggest something I would appreciate it. Delusional neighbors",Suicidal,"{""category"": ""Anxiety""}",2025-04-21 01:38:40.624787,e5-large-v2

"I feel like there is something fundamentally broken with me.*Everyone* told me that after high school I would feel better. I do not think I have ever felt worse in my entire life than I do right now. I have no passions, no aspirations, I do not like doing anything and I have no idea of what to study in university/college. But I *have to* because it is not like I can get myself a decent job if I start crying everytime someone looks at me in public. Between depression and social anxiety my will to live or do anything is pretty much negative. My parents keep yelling at me because finishing high school did not magically cure me. Honestly I hate existing, I hate existing with every single fiber of my being. I feel like shit everyday and people keep telling me to ""appreciate the small things"" as if thinking that a sunset is pretty for 3 seconds will make up for the fact that I have been crying myself to sleep for the past 2 years. fuck you.

The friend that was turned against me would ask me what I was doing everyday, and I would say I am watching videos, but instead watching ways how people killed themselves.I just wanted to feel appreciated and cared about, but I cannot have that. When my friend hugged me weeks ago in a library, I was thinking this would be my last hug before I go. He always made me happy and laugh a lot, and that would be the last. I wish this pandemic did not exist, because it made the people I was friends with different now. I want someone who can listen to how I feel and to be comforted. Someone who can give warm hugs and supportive advice, a shoulder to cry on. I do not know when to do it, but when I find a day and time, I will finally be happy.

"unloved I feel like I’m too hard to love. I’m in my late 20s, and I have bp II. I’ve been medicated and going to therapy regularly for years but I still have mood swings etc. i thought I managed it well? I’m a lesbian and I try really hard to make relationships work but in the end I’m always too much. I even escaped an abusive one. It hurts so badly. Especially when i think about the fact that in multiple relationships, when my partners were going through their depressions (not bipolar but reg depression) I held them down, to the point of putting their needs and feelings above my own and neglecting myself (which I now know is unhealthy). And then they get better..But the second I start struggling I’m “too much” and they don’t know if they can do it. It’s frustrating because I’m really upfront about the fact that I have bp II and they’ll say it doesn’t matter etc but when the symptoms show up they bail. If you ask my exes or anyone I’ve dealt with romantically 9 times out of 10 they’ll describe me as sweet/bubbly and one said I was amazing. But if that’s true why can’t they love me.

However last year and a half i've felt like my symptoms have changed a lot, though i still have all the BPD symptoms, some symptoms like avoidance, social anxiety, isolation, feeling less, came up from nowhere. For matter of fact, i stopped talking to all my ""friends"", stopped working, going out, date, i stopped living. This winter i didn't go out of my appartement, and if it wasn't for my mother, i would probably have died of hunger. Going out doesn't scare me, people outside does. I feel like they all stare at me and they know how shitty i am, i feel like i'm not like them and whatever i do i'm not enough. Even open the shutters is a damn burden.

"Sorry in advance for lengthy post. To start, my husband (41) &amp; I (40) have been together for about 25 years. I have gone through dark stages in my life. Suicidal thoughts + failed attempts. I used work as a coping method but I did not get anywhere with my work. still a manager while an account assistant I worked with 10+ years ago is now a Director. Due to unexpected post partum complication, I was hospitalized after giving birth. Hormone roller coaster. Zero visitors b/c of Covid. Finally was on antidepressant. I stopped them after hospital discharge. Fast forward to now, I start to feel that our marriage and feelings for each other has changed. I understand dynamics change with a baby but why do I always feel hes cheating? Sex life is nonexistent since pregnancy. We were both very excited and blessed with this child as conceiving was difficult. the happiest moment in our lives became the saddest at the same time. Enduring the pain of not being able to see my newborn meanwhile , He took care of our baby himself. Its as if we fought our own battles. It was not easy for both of us &amp; I thought it would only make us stronger. Yet why do I feel the opposite?I have had similar episodes before where I feel our marriage is failing &amp; all I wanted was to leave this world. I have started having same sad feelings. Sensitivity level is high. quickly boils down to a failed relationship. he has not been sleeping well the past few days. The other day he suddenly woke up and went for his morning walk with the dog. Typically, wed go together. I called him as I could not see him at the park. Finally he came back and I asked him where he was &amp; that I called him five times. He pulled out his phone &amp; said he had it on silent somehow. I do not know why my first instinct was that he met up with someone. Maybe because his walk was much longer than usual? I know hes been bothered by work lately but my first thought his insomnia was possibly because this other woman is pregnant or something(?)Yesterday was tough. I was sick to my stomach with the feeling hes definitely seeing someone. I was quite certain hell leave us. That He has already forgotten about our baby, our love, our excitement when we first learned of the news. Thoughts came rushing in. Sadness swelled up my body. I had thoughts of leaving, I craved alcohol and had a few sips. The feeling of leaving this world was strong. The emptiness. The feeling that you have lost everything. The pain of feeling sorry for bringing my child here. The disgusted feeling of being weak and feeling like a coward. I am not even qualified to be a mom and my baby will be better off without me. Our baby turned one and still young so maybe husband will Be able to find a better mom. And while holding my baby to sleep, I asked if I can bear not being able to see the beautiful smile, hear the laughter and chuckles. And as the thoughts came about, they flooded my eyes. I feel I am doing more harm than good to my baby. Will my baby forgive me? knowing its probably better developmentally , does it matter if I am forgiven?Perhaps it would have been better for everyone if I had just died with the complication last year.

"Here we go again: EMDR Take 2 I have PTSD as the result of an extensive history of sexual abuse. My therapist guided me through 9 months of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) in 2016. It was BRUTAL, but my symptoms were nearly nonexistent after we finished it up. I recently have had some symptoms pop back up, and after an assessment it appears that I’m in need of a “tune up” as my therapist calls it. So here we go again... I’m starting it again today. I hope that it’ll be a little less sucky since I’ve put some hard work into it previously and that it’ll be short-lived compared to 9 months of nonstop weekly EMDR sessions. I’m still EXTREMELY anxious as I get closer and closer to my appointment today because I know that things will get worse before they get better.

Has anyone been through EMDR before? Do you have any coping skills that help you, especially in between sessions when your brain is processing everything? 

PS: For the record, I’m not trying to scare anyone who is facing the possibility of going through this process. Doing EMDR has changed my life for the better. I’ve had PTSD as long as I can remember, and the relief that it’s brought me has been amazing. Just stick it out until it gets better.

"Hi all, in my short 19 years on this earth I have been through many trials and triumphs but my life seems to be getting progressively worse and I have not had the best life I ever and already feel like I have lived a lifetime worth of experiences due to the trauma I have experienced in my life like: sexual, emotional, physical abuse, stabbed someone when I was 17 and attacked them with mallet due to bullying, being involved with a police chase, surviving car accident, being a addict and addicted to alcohol at age 17 until last (year age 19),being deaf in left ear from birth, survived surgery, survived many illness and infection as a young child, and being revived at birth due to oxygen loss, severe bullying, I have had around 50-60 suicidal episodes last year and have had many more prior. I managed to obtain my NCEA Lvl 1,2,3 even though I was kicked out of school due to being sevely bullied and having everyone hate me, I have had many fun sexual experiences, done some pretty crazy and one of a kind stuff, seen and done things alot of people could ever do etc. I always made sure to live every day as if it was my last and live fearless so I have lived my life on the edge and to the fullest although I was lonely and sad alot of it due to anxiety and past trauma. But things were starting to look up around last year I acquired a good job and a wonderful partner S.C. ironically I had my car accident 15mins after I dropped her off at a friend's place as she stayed at mine and we had only met in person the night before. But our relationship prospered and that crash made me become clean from alcohol and drugs because of the thought of her and prospect of career and family I have always wanted to raise children and live on a farm in the countryside etc. But... My life has changed for the worst now=Initially my illness started about 1am on Jan 18th 2021 after I awoke from a vivid nightmare drenched in sweat then I had an auditory hallucination and diahorrea and vertigo and derealization/confusion and brainfog and was shivering with chills but after I went back to sleep it went away within 1-day and in between time I went on holiday and suffered vertigo and ear pain on the car ride down and the initial sickness did not appear until Feb 9th I got the bad flu w/sore throat, vertigo, ear pain, coughing, running nose, chills, diahorrea etc. And on Feb 13th I then suffered derealization, severe brainfog, crying and sadness and anxiety, REM sleep issues like: falling sensation that jolts awake, flashing behind eyelids, hypnogogic hallucination, constant vivid nightmares every night, head pressure, diahorrea, excessive urination and short-term memory loss and a bunch of other stuff then around early March came a psychotic ocd presentation where I had this delusion I was developing shitzophrenia and had an intense fear of it and constantly Googled it then that sort of stopped and the derealization died down a bit and I was left with andeonia complete loss of emotions and then severe depression and mood swings the came these mini-stroke/seizures and severe brainfog that happened around start of last month and every time I had them I was getting memory-loss after long term and short-term almost dementia like memory loss then I developed an internal vibration. So currently of now my symptoms are: a slight brainfog, internal vibration, dementia memory-loss, vivid nightmares: still having hypnogogic hallucination upon waking, minor head pressure, crying and sadness/severe depression, and complete loss of emotional enjoyment in life, loss of track of time and what is going on around me, inability to retain information, loss of imagination, hair thinning, easily bruising, loss of libido, abdomen pain. So as of now I am 5.5 months into this illness and shts only getting worse I have had many blood tests, tried different diets, meds help with mood but none of the other symptoms, tried therapy, had 2 CT scans of head w/o Contrast tried heaps nothing works. I personally think it is maybe autoimmune encephalitis due to a virus, covid maybe? Not sure. So yeah I am pre much F'ed atm. Me and my girlfriend do long distance and she has stuck by me all through this, she flys up to where I live today as her family lives here and she comes up every school holidays I love her so much and she says she loves and supports me and will do till death and we are keeping each other alive as she struggles with her own issues too but I just feel useless and dead. An example is my nana she is in a dementia home and you look into her eyes and the life is just gone... No soul, just a lost mind trapped within a body that imprisons her that is how I feel atm and I do not want this to go on forever as I cannot feel life and emotions and feel severaly disconnected from everything and have impaired cognitive function as well as experiencing symptoms on the daily. I have always had a different insight on life I feel and have always thought and felt different from others idk why but I just have I feel special in this world and sometimes I wonder if it is just me alive and everyone else is figure of imagination idek haha. My plan is too spend my last 2-weeks with her and then if I feel no better or see no reason to continue then I will end it. Sorry for all the words and wall of text you prolly do not need my life story but I want to make sure my story is read by atleast someone before I go.As many of you know its a dog eat dog world and weakness is not tolerated and only the strongest survive unfortunately I am no longer strong and just a she will of a man really so yeah I was crying afraid of death and asking why this has happened to me for ages every night alone but I now realise maybe the good go first so we do not experience as much suffering as the bad who live on and generally die alone. The world is a strange place atm and is just full of pain, narcassism, suffering, corruption.

I had success but most of the money went to investors (founded a company that sold for $27M). Have been working on another startup for 8 years and making minimal income and living off savings. Doing it all myself as I do not trust people anymore. Been through a divorce caused by this and was in a marriage that meant I could not properly run my new startup for most of that time. Ex took half my assets and I am sure was putting a lot extra away for years.It is ridiculously hard. I have a product as good as anything in the market and comparable to other products raising 10's of millions of dollars. But I cannot get it out there, nothing I do works enough. I now have a product that probably requires a team of developers and I am maintaining it all myself and trying to grow the business.I am just so tired, burnt out and depressed I cannot do the things I need to do to make this work anymore and I feel I am going to lose everything.The only thing keeping me going is the thought that I have the product and the hope that one day I will get noticed or will be able to get my marketing sorted and get in front of the right customers.I feel I am going backwards and everyone I know seems to be going forward on easy mode. Home are going up in value (we sold our beautiful big house in the divorce and now renting), well paying jobs with minimal effort (IT).I just spent my entire weekend working and doubt it will make a dent while other people are enjoying their lives.I will never find a partner again as I am financially ruining myself.I just want to end it all but my 10 year old daughter still needs me. It would devastate her if I was gone. For the last few years I have just been thinking try to last as long as you can until she does not need you as much (maybe 16). I am not living for any future now, I do not look forward to anything. Every day I wake up and say to myself 'I want to die'.She is still full of hope and tells me about her dream house and dream bedroom etc and says things like ""daddy when your website gets better do you think we could get a new house etc"".

I do not want the responsibility to be mine. Id rather die. I want to die. But I cannot. I cannot hurt you anymore. Even dying is selfish right now. I end my own suffering and then what?I hate myself I hate myself ugh I want to rip my skin away. No that is not enough. I want to be decimated till my very last quark. I love you I love you I loved you. Why why whyTheres not even a struggle to call mine. I have nothing. Nothing. there is no one else to blame for any of this.

"Back story how I got to where I am. I am 20F and I moved in with my boyfriend a few months ago. Everything was going great until I got depressed again. I could take care of myself properly, could not get myself motivated to do anything, slept in later than I should. And my bf tried to help me in a way I told him time and time again that it would not work. For some reason everytime someone in my life pushes me to do things that I am scared of or have a hard time doing, I just shut down completely. I agree I was pretty terrible to live with. Some days I helped out so much around the house and other days I could not get myself to do anything at all. I also did not have a job because he would not jump start my car because he was so afraid of me crashing my car on purpose (I would not do that). Flash forward to three weeks ago: everything got worse, we started fighting constantly. He told me I should have tried harder and he was right. He said it was killing him to see me like this. He said if I did not get myself fixed or start doing more for myself that hell kick me out. So I slowly started to do more and take care of myself. However, we still fought constantly. I still could not get him to realize how I felt the way I do and could not get him to start my car. So with that being said I still could not get a job and he hated that. Flash forwarded again, last night he packed up all of my things and kicked me out. The entire time telling me he felt so bad for doing this but it all my fault. Then he got moody and told me that until I get better that we can only be friends. So I was crying hysterically and could not drive myself back to my parents so, he had to take me home. I had a bad panic attack to the point I could not breathe and my whole body was all locked up joint wise. Took him a bit to realized that I was not just trying to get him to let me stay and I needed help with it. He told me if I start making progress with myself that we can start seeing eachother again but I feel lost. My parents are so mad at me because I failed my relationship. They because very strict with me and are pushing me the exact way I told them it would not help. there is more but this is the just of what happened. I just need someone to listen and encourage me to do better.",Depression,"{""category"": ""Stress""}",2025-04-21 01:46:01.539905,e5-large-v2

I don’t want to blame external factors but there has been constant miscommunication which also led to where we’re at.

Going to online school to keep mind occupied but will fall asleep for 24-36 hrs after a 6hr course day. Tried using free therapy but cops showed up to house to take me to ER after telling Dr over phone that idealizition was getting to point I was having visions of doing it and waking up confused when I was still at my computer desk. Overheard nephew telling people all I do is sleep and that he does not like that I lived with him. Dad stopped having genuine conversations with me after talking to the cops. Last thing he said was I should not put him through lossing a son. Now when I talk to him it seems like he is annoyed or wants me to figure out how to be happy. Other family members or friends have told me to get over it after telling them what the Dr told me.

I used to either tell my friends I’m sick, or just talk to them over the phone to something. 2014 is when I developed my first real disease, called Visual Snow, symptoms are where you are tiny dots over your vision, like pixels. Luckily I’ve managed to ignore that and accepted it as a part of me. 

At age 16 I dropped out of high school because I was unable to wake up in the morning and get ready. Since I dropped out of high school I developed BDD (Body Dysmorphia). It became so bad that I never went out in daylight. I checked the mirrors every 30 minutes, hated my face, etc.  Now I’m 18 and have noticed 4 months ago that my tongue twitches in the mirror (fasciculations). I even read ALS patients never feel their twitches in the tongue. Just like me. At this point, I take it as it is.

"I keep missing my meds and honestly don't think I care anymore I've been so good about always taking my meds when I'm supposed to since I started treatment, but for the past few months I just can't seem to remember to take them like I'm supposed to. On top on that, I've gained so much weight since being on them and I'm just so fucking tired all day, every day. 

I'm just so over it all. Like everything. I haven't worked in like three years because I'll lose my insurance if I can even manage to find something I'm able to do.

could not really find the perfect title its more about the process of finding someone which I would consider dating and I was wondering if someone here felt the same or experienced the same and might give me some advice.So I had this happen a few times in the last year where I get to know someone and it feels like I am completely falling in love with the other person even tho I barely know them just because it feels nice being around them. But it really hit me a week ago. I met this girl at a party and we had a one night stand sorta. We could not sleep alot so we just layed next to each other talked and kissed for like 6 hours till 11am.I have not felt better in the last year. I just felt safe being with her. When I woke up that night I did not think about how I wanted to sleep again or how I would just like to kill myself my mind was at rest atleast for a while.do not get me wrong I liked that girl but I barely know her and she is probably not even really my type but I still feel like I would do anything for her or for being with her again and more often. Its not rational but this happens so often although this time the feeling is so much stronger. I feel like I am being so heavily influence by the fact that I am not feeling good at all. This makes things like that so much stronger and I cannot think rational. I cannot distinguish between the feeling of me actually being into someone or just being into the feeling I get when I am around them. And you could probaly change that girl with any other random one and Id feel the same for just that person. Just because I did not think about blowing my brains out while next to her I feel like she is the one.Anyways thanks for reading. Similar storys/thoughts and advice very much appreciated.

"Thanks for being the community I never dreamt to have  

so yesterday I had a therapy session, and the therapist asked why i think  i have no friends.

i answered i have interests that few share, where i live as i live in a small city, so it is hard to have friends or form relations based on interests. also, i have no interest in sports and that is the common interest where i live 

i told him i am part of many online communities, but i just lurk as i feel that i don't belong enough to participate in  these communities even if they are based on my interests

at that moment i remembered reddit and this community, and i felt that i already have a community where i can freely be who i am without  fear

When I joined reddit it was for something tech related, then i said why not searching for avoidant and i was expecting nothing but to my surprise i found this sub, and it was unbelievable as it is hard to find anything related to avoidant

i was new to reddit and navigating it, but i was happy as i found people like me.

as i kept browsing, i started to get related more and more to your posts. I felt a connection to you,  and i realized i am not alone anymore.

Knowing i am not alone anymore, is one of the greatest things anyone can ask for, it meant i have People who can understand me and my struggle and what i am going through.

People who can understand me and i can understand them.

People with who i can share whatever i want, knowing they will understand me and won't judge me 

in this community,i don't hesitate or feel shy to share anything with you

from sharing memes to asking questions and seeking help and advice

here, I share my problems and secrets that no one knows, including my family.

I finally found a home here and family 

this community really seems like an oasis in the desert 

I have more to say about this community but i want to keep this post short as possible.

"Paranoia and Anxiety about that Brain Eating Amoeba Hi everyone. I'm pretty new to this sub, but I really need to vent.

 I was diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder two years ago and I generally have a pretty good hold of it. Yesterday, I was showering and a drop or two or water got into one nostril in my nose. I could feel it chilling in my nose hair and I immediately used my towel to wipe it out and then I blew my nose when I got out of the shower. However, I live in Florida, and I'm really paranoid that the brain eating amoeba is lurking in the water. This was water from the shower head in my dorm and it has been colder lately, but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I'm terrified; I'm even tearing up with fear writing this. My birthday is next week and I want to be okay for that and for everything. My mom said I'm worrying needlessly and she's probably right but I can't shake the anxiety.

"Paxil withdrawal induced hypomania/rapid cycle I f**ed up my life in just 2 weeks.

My brief history:

* fall 2014 was prescribed Paxil 20mg/day for mild depression, anxiety and hypochondria. 
* Tapered from 20mg to 10mg in 6 month.
* I was on 10mg since June 2015 till August 2017. So: 2 years, 10mg daily. I always took medicine before go sleep.
* I tapered from 10mg/day to 2.5mg/day in 5-7 months (August 2017 ~ March 2018)
* I stopped to take medication 2 weeks ago (20 of March).

Until this point I was TOTALLY FINE. 

Now detailed description of last 2 weeks:

* First 5 days were totally fine
* On day 6 (30 MArch) first withdrawals symptoms kicked in: shivering, cold, severe insomnia
* On day 12 (1 April) withdrawals was unbearable, experience first manic/depressive episode. Decided to reinstate on 5mg(and later 10mg)/day. I took my first half pill midday.
* Day 13 (2 April): 5mg morning, 5mg evening
* Day 14 (3 April): 5mg morning, 0mg evening
* Day 15 (4 April): 5mg morning, 5mg evening
* Day 16 (today, 5 April): 5 mg morning

The symptoms I have now are rather painful and hardly bearable. Most prominent are: RAPID cycling from depressive episodes(+moredate agitation and anxiety) to hypomanic episodes and severe insomnia. Cycles changing every few hours and quite intensive! I never had this before, never!! Now I'm totally off, confused, suicidal, haven't slept cople nights. I'm in  hypomanic episode right now so I can write this post. I took sick leave at my work, but if this will continue I will lose my job completely. I beg you for advice on how I can stabilize now, based on what I've already done. I'm not even looking to weaning off meds now, as there are a lot of life circumstances now that I responsible for. I just want to stabilize and reduce pain.
What I can do at this point? It's do hard to believe I broke my brain beyond repair so rapidly, just in 2 weeks. I was normal, happy and fully of life. Now I'm anxious, agitated and depress vegetable, lying on the coach wanting to die/suicide.
Any advice highly appreciated.

P.S. yes, I visited my GP,  he put me on a waiting list to mental illness clinic (waiting time ~4 weeks) and advised to continue Paroxetine 10mg/day for 2 weeks and then increase to 20mg/day if needed.

He also told me that my right pupil was smaller then the left one so he called some neurologist and he did some tests but there was nothing wrong with them.

"Vitamin D and B-12 Deficiency Sorry about lack of clarity, I’m not exactly sure how to phrase this because I’m confused myself, and I am on mobile.

I sought out treatment after I was having some pretty concerning suicidal thoughts the past year.

I reached out the a therapist at my University, and immediately was referred to a psychiatrist under the guise of maybe benefitting from mood stabilizers.

Before my psychiatry appointment, I researched into mood stabilizers and saw they were used in treating bipolar. Read up on bipolar and really identified/ understood why she would recommend me to the psychiatrist assuming she thought I could have bipolar. 

Met with the psychiatrist, and not to my surprise she said she was sure I was bipolar. However she wanted me to get bloodwork before starting me on lithium to see my levels in various things. She said she was going to diagnose me official with unspecified mood disorder until she saw my results regarding my thyroid. 

I was pretty bummed hearing this news, she essentially told me I had bipolar disorder but lacked whether it was I or II, so I still felt lost but like I was on the right track.

Well, my blood work came back and everything was normal except I had extremely low vitamin D and B-12. My psychiatrist called me and gave me dosage for otc vitamins. I read into the situation wrong and assumed she was just reducing my issues down to deficiencies.

I know these two deficiencies do not explain mania. Maybe vitamin D explains psychosis, but I don’t experience this. I felt like everyone was so sure I was bipolar and led me on to thinking I had a solution, and I think this issue runs deeper than just supplements.

I know many mental illnesses have links to vitamin deficiencies, and I guess my confusion comes from whether or not anyone else experienced this along with being bipolar. I have an appointment on Thursday, first one since bloodwork, and was wondering if I should mention the bipolar diagnosis if she doesn’t.

TLDR; is my doctor reducing her diagnosis to needing vitamin d and b-12? Can this and bipolar coincide? ",Bipolar,"{""category"": ""Bipolar""}",2025-04-21 01:51:40.107911,e5-large-v2

"How being outside reduces stress I will explain why being outside is good for your health. Nowadays we are often indoors almost all day because of school and work. There’s not always something wrong with that, but you’ll probably feel a lot better if you go outside every now and then.

**IT MAKES THE MIND CLEARER**

Inside a house, study or workplace there are often many things that make you think about your work or study. There is nothing wrong with this, but it can ensure that you are constantly busy with your work or study. This may keep you thinking and living in your head instead of in the moment. In addition, there are all kinds of other distractions indoors that keep your mind from calming down. So go outside and enjoy the tranquility.

**LESS STRESS**

This tranquility automatically reduces stress. You are not busy with school, your work, or other things. As a result, you go out of your head and into the moment. This will also reduce your stress and reduce the risk of stress symptoms and complaints. In addition, physical exercise is also a great way to reduce stress. When you are physically active you can reduce stress. You probably also feel that when you exercise. And after you exercise you notice that your stress is reduced compared to before you started exercising.

"I have been struggling with depression since my mid/late teens. I am in college now; and I thought Id be better once I moved away from my family( toxic). However I think I might have actually gotten worse. All the stress for deadlines, rent, if I have enough money for food, if I can afford medicine for my cold, it just keeps building up. I am not sure if I want to handle the stress of being an adult. I cannot help but imagine running away and disappearing from the world. Devolving into my self and then into the water and ceasing to exist. It sounds so much easier than life. I took on a computer science degree durring the pandemic. I wanted to learn a new profitable skill so I could eventually support myself with a secure and I demand job. However online college, its not how my brain learns. From distanced learning; I cannot process and if the information, and if I took the time to relearn every lesson from a tutor ( I learn best being taught in person) then I would not have the time to earn money and study, or the means to eat a proper meal. And if I finished my freshman year of college not retaining any information; I feel like I am screwed for the next year. If I have spent so much money and time just to show no improvement; why am I even here. I want to drop out if college. But then Id have to work a minimum wage or lower job and try to support myself and still deal with the stress of being an adult. When ever my depression gets very bad I start seeing things out of the corner of my eye. Normally its ropes and Nuces hanging from trees or light posts . If it continues then I start to see peoples dead body hanging from them. Just out of the corner of my eye, then Ill turn to look. And there is nothing there.I do not think I even check if its real anymore. Its just become the shadow of people in the corner of my eye , swinging slightly with the wind.

For the first time in 2 years, I realized that my problems did have a solution and a date. They were eventually going to end, but committing suicide was the only mistake I was not able to retract from.I felt regret. I felt treater for all the things I did not do.

Miracles happen, and me being able to write this is one of them.I did not die. I cannot explain how. I drank 100 pills, did not go to the hospital, and somehow managed to survive.Today, one of my friends called me. She even invited me to a trip.I thought I was alone. I thought no one cared about me.

"Lumps on neck and head now. Okay so first of all thank you for reading this, I am struggling with bad anxiety right now. 

I have had two lumps on the side of my neck for 2 years now and have been told in the past by a doctor that they were nothing. I was put on antibiotics (which didn't seem to help) and sent away. I recently had them checked out again and the doctor ordered an ultrasound (which I have yet to go to) to make sure they weren't cancer. I have zero symptoms otherwise.

 Fast forward to now I have a larger lump on the back left side of my scalp. I'm trying to tell myself it's just a cyst but the anxious pattern seeking side of me is having a hard time time letting it go.  It's larger than the other two and is  hard and hurts a little when I apply pressure. 

There are a few causes I can think of 

1. It's just a cyst, and completely unrelated to my other two swollen lymph nodes. My fathet has a history of cysts, which may account for mine.

2. I'm pretty sure I remember hitting my head on something about a week ago, so it could just be a bruise of sorts. (memory isn't clear)

3. Cancer. I'm gonna die, hit the panic button, ect...

4. I recently have been having allergies or a cold which could be due to an infection which could be making my lymph nodes react. 


This is the way my anxious mind sees it: I must have cancer because there is now a third lump to add on the other two I've had for years. I've left it untreated for so long that I'm scared to even go to a doctor. Now it must be spreading to my brain which would probably make it inoperable. I will get brain cancer and die at 19 due to my lack of action.

I'm honestly having trouble deciphering hypochondria from reality.

I'm hoping someone besides myself could make a determination as to whether or not I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thank you.

"Hi all, first time here hope you guys are doing well. To start, I can tell you that being a 5 foot tall male living here in America is worse than death. Everyone treats me like absolute shit, from strangers, friends, family, and of course women. it is already challenging making friends, dating life is on a whole other level of difficulty. I have had countless instances from strangers to even family giving me dirty looks, treating me unfairly solely for my height. I have followed the advice of what short males should do, such as working on yourself by improving looks, earning money, confidence, personality, etc. I have done all that, I am an attractive guy, I have money, and I am muscular for my size. I workout and I am 160lbs at 18% bodyweight, which is huge for my size. Despite all these positives that everyone says you should focus on, it has not changed a thing as far as dating life. There has been two instances in which I have been told the exact quote ""I would date you if you were taller"" by my crushes, once in high school and the other recently in college, and these events destroyed me. I do not get any attention from women even though I have all these attributes. I cannot really blame them because they can probably find someone else who has exactly all the same qualities as me, only that they are taller so why the fuck would they go for me? I am nothing special. I am currently 20, studying a passion that I love at a good university, and I have a family that cares for me. Those are the only reasons I have not offed myself yet. My parents have used so much of their time and money putting into my education and life, and I know if I kill myself my entire family's life will be ruined forever. And my depression/suicidal thoughts are completely hidden from them because I am too embarrassed to tell them or anyone else for the matter. it is just not an option, I am sorry. Reflecting on my current life, I literally have no friends. Barely had any success dating wise. These past years have made me turn into a person that I never thought I would become. I began hating everyone I see, especially if they were taller because I keep questioning why life fucked me over for my height while everyone else gets to enjoy theirs normally. And I am sorry if you think this is not a reason for suicide, but to me it is been the biggest problem of my life that I just cannot handle any longer. I really do not know how much longer I can tolerate this. I fear that I will never get to live a normal life as everyone else from enjoying time with friends to being loved romantically with a partner, so why would I waste anytime and just end it all now?

"Battling with intrusive thoughts Tw: (thoughts of) self harm, drug abuse, suicidal thoughts 
(m/22, if you care)


First things first, I really need to vent right now and dont know if anyone is even gonna read that but I just need to get this out of my head.
And sorry, if my english isn't good...

So, I've been battling depression for over a decade, I've mostly gotten better after years of therapy and carefully choosing the people around me so I've been pretty stable for a few years with less and less backlashes.

Today marks the first day after about 3 years where I'm getting extremely intense thoughts about self harming, drug abuse and even suicidal thoughts.

I've already been in a pretty bad mood today, overthinking a lot and shit like that and I had to go to social event I didn't really wanna take part in but usually it turns out better than expected. It wasn't like that today. I've felt even worse and useless (despite my friends trying to cheer me up) and realized that I'm not good at anything. I tried to drink those thoughts away with some cocktails (which usually works wonders for me in social events) but that just made it worse.
Since I got home I've just been sitting on my bed and staring at the wall, my thoughts going through a downward spiral. I drank some more and feel better and worse at the same time. I've even got to the point that I noticed another issue I haven't even realized before but makes so much sense comparing it to the events in my life. Then I thought of numbing my pain with a method I used years ago, forced myself not to because the scars have almost faded out. Then I thought about what drugs I could use to distract my mind, even started to research before I stopped myself and decided to rant here.
I'm very aware of my thoughts which makes me instantly feel regretful and even more like a shitty person.

I just want to cry and try to vent through that but that's something I still can't do. Love society for teaching boys that they aren't allowed to cry.

Anyways, I hope I can force myself to focus on something else now that I've written this shit down. My mind does feel a bit clearer now without taking some extreme steps.

Also to everyone reading this: I hope you have a great day tomorrow. And maybe we can all fight our inner demons some day and live a better life. Just trying to survive one day at a time.",Depression,"{""category"": ""Depression""}",2025-04-21 02:00:38.001377,e5-large-v2

Perhaps I just want someone to notice. Someone to acknowledge the fact I am suffering. I feel so unseen. All of my suicide attempts I failed on purpose because I desperately wanted someone to see that I really was doing badly and just wanted to be loved and cared for. I am in a position where I cannot seek mental help, and I know that I am awful for doing this. I am just so desperate for someone to care and check up on me.

"Terrified of brain amoeba / fowleri Hi everyone. I'm down in South Australia, and I've found myself going a little insane over something very silly for the last day....

I will start by saying that our water has a decent amount of chlorine as far as I can tell, it's the only thing you can taste in the water, and if you fill a bathtub it's even ever so slightly green. There's never been an order to boil water or anything of the sort either here.

So moving onto story time. I often get itchy eyes before bed, so I keep a glass of water in the bathroom, that way I can rinse my eyes out quickly to calm things down, the glass of water had probably been out for a few hours, anywhere from 6- 12. Last night I did it, and as the water ran down my face a little bit got in my nose, maybe a drop or 2 tops. I started freaking a minute later as I remembered all I'd read about fowleri.... I blew my nose a bunch, and I rolled up some toilet paper, and stuck it up my nostril as well in an attempt to deal with any water that had made its way up there. I spent a terrified hour in bed reading things on my phone, and eventually calmed down enough to sleep.

Now all day today I haven't had a fever or anything of the sort, but I have been getting sinus headaches. (Quite possibly from blowing my nose so much) And I got rather paranoid in the shower too, anytime water got near my nose, or even the tiniest bit might have entered I freaked out a bit. My right nostril which is the one the water entered is also worse than the left, but the discomfort might just be from me freaking out and blowing it a ton... I have bad sinuses at the best of times, so it could just be dust or allergies too.

I know I'm probably being silly, but some confirmation would be lovely, especially since the glass of water, while cold was sitting out a long time... A day of sinus headaches just doesn't exactly fill me with confidence, even if it probably was cause I wouldn't leave things alone. One last thing to note is that 2 family members of mine recently had colds, so that might be why I'm feeling crappy sinus wise too, the right side being worse than the left still has me all freaked out though.",Anxiety,"{""category"": ""Anxiety""}",2025-04-21 02:01:33.906361,e5-large-v2

Reup to your laser hair removal so you can look at yourself in the mirror crying. A new pair of underwear because you are somehow down to just three? Everything is too fucking expensive.

I recently made a promotion to a supervising position, but frankly, it does not do much to me. it is not that I miss my old work that much, but it just does not trigger anything inside of me.

"How do you even begin to explain your depression? I am hurting and I feel super alone. I have people around me and I am sure they will listen, but to what extent? I have ended up here because I feel like I am imploding and just want someone to hear me and know what I feel. I am a wife and a mother of one. My marriage is happy and my son is amazing, but I cannot get away from my depression and anxiety. I have had a bounty of traumatic experiences growing up, but who has not? I truly try to live for each day and leave the past where it belongs. I am extremely self-aware. I understand my mental illness. I am a very analytical person. I think that because of this, it makes my mental health worse. I want to fix myself, but I do not know how. I have extreme fears of being alone. I am terrified my husband will eventually decide to leave me because I am such a disaster (though he has shown no intention of this at all). Who wants to be married to a crazy person, right? I have never been in a relationship that was not emotionally abusive until I married my husband. Both of my parents were drug addicts and I was raised by my grandparents (who are incredible by the way). My biological mother (who was physically and emotionally abusive) is still a piece of work (putting it nicely). It took years, but my dad recovered and I do love him very much even though he still has some issues I am still uncomfortable with. In spite of that I have become a successful person. I swore Id never ever let my children see a moment of what I did as a child, and I have not, but I am still here feeling like a failure. I feel worthless. My insecurity is disgusting and my fears are eating me alive. I guess it does not help that I have barely any friends and now that I am working from home I am basically left to my own torment, every day. I used to have loads of friends when I lived in another city, but once I became pregnant I decided I needed to be closer to family. I did not move back home, just near. So I moved to a small town where I know no one. After starting my job once I moved. I have begun to have friends again, but none of them I feel close enough to be able to really open up. Honestly they are probably very open to listening, but I am still here terrified of judgment and causing what little friends I do have to go running for the hills. Because who wants to be friends with someone so mentally unstable?I am tired of crying and I want my brain to stop. I just want to fix my mental state. I can fix everything else. I can give the best advice and I have picked so many people up from very low points in their lives, but I cannot fix me. I am so sorry this is so long.

"Pulsatile tinnitus So over the last week or so I've noticed that for about 10-15 seconds each day, I've heard a pulsing sound in my ear that sounds like a fan whirring. At first I thought it was an external sound, but then I pinned it down to coming from inside my head when I was in the bathroom one time. I googled it and it came up with pulsatile tinnitus, and it said the cause could be tumours, aneurysms, high blood pressure, hearing loss etc. 

I hear it in my right ear, and as I said it's normally for around 10 seconds a day at random times. I've been unable to trigger it or find a way to induce it; there seems to be no pattern to it. Which is odd because people who mention this talk of it being constant.  

I exercise regularly and do cardio, and I'm cutting down on my caffeine consumption to see if that helps. I've heard this can be a symptom of anxiety or can just be heightened awareness of my own body, which makes sense but don't exactly know what that means. You'd think I'd have noticed this before.

"My Goodbye NoteI am tired, I do not even know where to start, but I am tired. Ever since I was little, my dream has been studying and becoming a professional in a career I can be proud of. I was the type to take college classes in high school so I could expedite the process. When I got the opportunity to move the USA at the age of 15, of course I said yes. Yes, dad! Of course I want to go. The land of opportunity, the land of the free. It has been more than 10 years, and I have been anything but free. I am 26 years old, and I have not started my career. I am an illegal immigrant. I cannot graduate, drive or work (unless I do so illegally, which has never been my desire; breaking the rules has always been my worst nightmare). Doing the wrong thing completely paralyzes me. I do not suppose dad knew what he was doing when he moved us to this country. And yes, I could have left, but it does not work like that in our family, where the man of the house is the ruler and tyrant. Leaving meant having nowhere to go with no roof over my head or food in my stomach. I have always struggled to make friends, I guess they all have sensed the brokenness that is in me and ran the other way. As the months go by, my interest in people diminishes. I want to be left alone. do not talk to me, do not look at me, do not breathe on me (please ignore all this and love me anyways). Just give up on me and leave (please fight for me). I understand I am hard to love, which makes this decision a little easier. Dad, even though you were tough on me, I know you were just as broken as me. I do not want to follow in your footsteps. I tried. I really tried. But I am you. Mom, I love you so much and I am sorry. You do not deserve to lose your only daughter, but I cannot do this anymore. Hubby. You have tried your best to be patient and be there for me. But my presence is a burden that you do not deserve to handle. I hope you find love again.

Like even if I lived my idea of a perfect life I think Id still feel empty inside because what is the point of anything really?I feel like this is not something you can even tell someone in real life because they will think you are suicidal.

"I can't cope with my job I work from home as a software developer, most aspects of the job are too triggering, and I can’t handle it.

Every morning starts with a daily update meeting. Since I usually had done only 0-30 minutes of work the previous day, I have no update to give, I panic and have to lie, and the lie is transparent. Afterwards I have to cool down from the shame, guilt, and stress. It’s already hard to recover from the procrastination because everything I do, with the code or on Slack, has a timestamp, a notification, and is visible to everyone. Once there’s something I’m avoiding (committing code, deploying code, posting the code for review, responding to someone, testing code, an upcoming meeting, etc.) I often go offline from inactivity, and then I’m afraid to even open my laptop (which can take hours to overcome) because once I do everyone can see I’m online on Slack; my procrastination then is immediately visible to the people who are impacted and who are looking for it i.e. people I’m not responding to, my manager.

I already got in trouble for not doing my work, missing meetings, not responding to people for days or weeks, and just not showing up some days without telling anyone. I was put on a month-long probation, which I’ve gotten past only because I didn’t ghost entire days during that time. I have frequent meetings with my manager and I have to pretend I’m struggling way less than I am. I can’t admit that half or more of the days I do absolutely nothing, or how much communicating with people — the most important part of the job — so fundamentally terrifies me.

I know every trick in the book about procrastination, time management, breaking down tasks, but that’s not enough when I’m this afraid of people. I’ve accepted I need help from another person. I’ve talked about this some with friends, but none of them understand, so all they can provide is sympathy. I have a psychiatrist and I’ve been trying to find a therapist, but they’ve all been unhelpful, many actively harmful.

I know it's a slow process, but every single day at work is like torture, and I’m on very thin ice. Because I can’t get the work done, it’s not endurable, and I don’t have the time or energy to work on all the other parts of my life in dire need of work. I don’t want to quit because I haven’t been here that long and I had a big gap between quitting my previous job (for the same reasons).

"Not sure where to start, I am finding life a constant struggle and I am tired and sick of it now. I feel like there is a massive weight crushing down on me. I cannot remember the last time I felt truly happy. I had an average childhood, my dad worked long hours so did not really build a relationship with him, my mam was the centre of the family. I suppose I will start when my family were involved in a horrific car accident, they all survived but sustained very severe injuries. My sister and mam were hurt the most, my sister was left with scars to her face but she battled through it and learn to live with it, my mam never really got over what happened to her. Life went on though and it became a memory we tried to forget. My mam then took Ill, she was diagnosed with cancer. We we all devastated but the surgeons had a plan and said they would fix it, she would survive but would need alot of surgery and rehabilitation, she went through the surgery and was on the road to recovery when she took her own life. Our world fell apart as you would imagine. She was a born worrier and I suppose the stress of it all just got too much for her. Again life went on although it was never the same again. I had my wife and children to focus on so the years passed as we carried on. I had the chance to take over and own the company I had worked at for many years so I took the opportunity to make a good life for my family,however the stress was immense and I could feel myself heading down and down into a breakdown, then I found out my wife had been having an affair with one of my best friends. This completely through me and destroyed every last thing I had in my life, I thought I could fix it, make it work with her but she no longer loved me so eventually I moved out. I set up home not far away from the family home and rebuilt my life for me and my children. I dated, had a few short relationships, then met someone who lives across the street, I thought this was the beginning of the rest of my life. Unfortunately, due to my wifes affair I now have trust issues, I find myself being controlling over my girlfriend. She continues to text her ex because they have 4 children together but this make me very anxious and causes alot of arguments between us. I have literally just told her we need to end our relationship because it is making me unhappy. To top this all off my sister has just been diagnosed with bowel and liver cancer, we were told its unlikely that its totally curable and that treatment will only slow it down. She adopted her son as a baby, hes now 9 years old, she is a single parent. My dad is not in the best of health but not life threatening, hes diabetic and struggles to control his sugar. I can see my life heading down a path I have no control over, I may lose my sister and dad over the next few years, I will be then responsible for raising my sisters adopted son, I have to work long hours to make ends meet but I do ok. I just feel like my whole like is falling apart and I am all alone. My kids are great but I only see them part time. Being completely honest they are the only thing keeping me going now but I am afraid that the way I feel that they might not be enough. I do not know what to do.

She deserves it. I made her a nice dish for dinner and she loved it.  She suggested we do a hockey game soon too and just little things together. She told me her friends want to meet me too and I felt honoured but she needs a babysitter first..

We are going out to brunch in a few days so I know she said she likes that distraction out of reading her books etc. Her birthday is coming up in a few weeks and was going to put a nice little gift together of candles, bath bombs etc..

what else can I do to help..

I know looking after her son helps a lot and she thanked me a lot and gave me a gift card to say thanks.

Hi, currently I am not diagnosed, I hope it does not bother anyone, but bipolar type 2 is being suspected by my psychiatrist. And I had some doubts (I'm not asking for diagnosis) because lately I have been going through dark days, but today something extremely strange happened to me that I do not know how to name or explain to my psychiatrist. If anyone has felt this way, I would appreciate it if you could tell me about your experience please. 

I was talking with a friend about my emotions, and I remember that from one moment to the next I got caught up in a specific thought (like a delusion). And then it was like I had emotionally exploded, I felt out of myself, I started sobbing very loudly, my breathing was heavy, I couldn't control or stop myself. But it wasn't like the moment or the conversation led me to it because of the intensity, it just happened. I was hugging myself, I couldn't stand him touching me. I felt like I was getting small. I really have no idea how to explain it, but what was most impressive to me was how spontaneous it was and that feeling of not being in control of my own body.

"Turning into alcohol Hey all. I'm getting worse. I've been battling depression ever since I finished high school, and it's been progressively getting worse. I thought getting a girlfriend would fix it, it doesn't. Nothing seems to help. I've come to realize life is pointless and it doesn't matter what I do to myself. I've been hurting myself, cutting, etc. and lately I've started drinking.

 It started with just a couple of nights of drinking on holiday. Then I realized hey I kind of like alcohol. Started to have a couple of beers a few times a week. Now I'm having them every night and bought my first large case of them ""just in case"" I wanna  have some beers the next night. 

I know this is a step to the worse and that I could stop right now with minimal discomfort. I just really don't care anymore and I want someone to notice I'm not okay because I can't really talk about it myself to the people I know. At the same time I don't want this to turn into full blown alcoholism because that would be bad, but at the same time I don't know if I even care that much anymore.

If I didn't have my family I would more than likely end my life.

"So all of this began like a month ago. I was in the process of getting out of a depressed situation and was finally getting better. However right as this was happening a chain of terrible misfortunes started happening to me. First I broke my finger and almost poisoned myself in the same day. I am like whatever, shit day but it happens right? So a few days pass and I had pretty much fixed my mood from the shit day and I realized something was wrong with me (it is kind of private so I will not go in detail) but I googled it and it turns out it is a cancer syndrome. I instantly talked to a doctor but he said it I would have to wait a while for him to be available. So I spend the next 2 weeks torturing myself mentally imagining the worst case scenarios to a point where i prepared a knife to off myself if I was diagnosed with cancer. I went to the doctor a few days ago and the test results should be out tomorrow. I was once again starting to feel better and convincing myself that it is going to be alright when just a few hours ago I fell and broke my foot. Why are all of these bad things happening to me? Why are they all happening in such a short amount of time? I am laying on my bed in horrible pain and worrying about my foot, and tomorrow I could be diagnosed with a life threatening disease. If the test results are fine I would probably get in a car crash or something. I cannot take it anymore. When I try to tell my friends about my problems they reply with ""Sucks I guess"" or something like that, my parents do not care either. I am lonely and going thru the hardest time of my life.

I watch behind my computer screen as people go about their lives, making accomplishments and being social, while I just stay in my room and plot my useless ideas. Mostly I just want it to end. Except I have no way to kill myself and every time I have tried has not worked out? I feel most days that the cosmos is taunting me for something I did wrong, and cannot figure out how to make things better. Pain follows pain. In all, I know that I have no way out except death.Most people think that they know loneliness, but nobody knows it better than me. I have very few friends, most of all people view me as an oddity who they do not want to spend time with. I have no boyfriend or girlfriend and I am basically never going to because I am both autistic and asexual. The solitary life might not be so bad if I did not have this craving for human contact that I have had for years (I am now 22). All I long for is to go out with people but I have no way of meeting them. I was bullied in high school and had to drop out. At university, I could not seem to make any because I was too depressed by various things. Covid did not help. And so I have gotten to a stage where I feel like a complete outsider in society, hating myself and divorced from the norms of everyone else. I have very obscure interests, philosophy and literature, and art and movies. On top of that, I do not have any career both because I find it sustain one and my autism.I am an artist, except what good is that if nobody cares about my art? I have made albums of music that nobody really listened to and I was too depressed to advertise. I have also just finished a novel that nobody is going to read. I thought for the past few years that I could express the unique aspects of how I view the world through art, but I do not think it matters. Nobody is interested in me. I could self-publish my book and then nobody will read it. And so I feel constantly invisible, like a ghost that walks through people embedded in the world. I have been forgotten; I do not belong here; I am just a strange cosmic absurdity.And so what are my options in life, go on every day in perpetual misery and loneliness having had many years of proof that nothing gets better?

As soon as I mention I want to talk about something serious they stop replying. At this point I am just done. I have lost hope. I just cut myself and watching the blood run down my arm was the closest thing to relief I have had. I just want to cut my arm from wrist to end of my arm and just bleed out. The pain feels amazing compared to the mental pain and losing blood feels so good. I think I am ready to go. I have experienced life and it has been nothing but pain and being used.

"For anyone on the fence about journaling, this is my experience so far... So I enjoy journaling for a few different reasons, and as I continue to do it, and get better at it, the more natural it feels, allowing you to really make use of it and get something out of it. Before this recent journaling expedition I had NEVER journaled.  Maybe stupid little doodles and quotes from songs or something in notebooks, but not really journaling, or for any real purpose.  I was somewhat curious and interested in the idea, as it had always been suggested to me by programs, institutions, therapists, etc..  however, I couldn't get past my biggest hurdle which was how to begin journaling without feeling really, really, silly, or like some teeny girl in highschool writing about people she doesn't like or her crushes or whatever.  It just felt awkward and silly.  I debated on doing it for a while and I think one day I said to myself to just do it, see how it goes, and do it day after day or just twice a day, even if all I write is a sentence, or a gratitude, or a to do list, the idea was just to start doing it and developing the healthy habit.  So my first entries were very crude.  I'm looking at one now and it basically says : 

THC NJ is COOL
APPLY TO JOBS
START NEW RPG
GONNA COOK STEAK
START READING DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? (finished it that week)
THIS IS MY 1ST TIME JOURNALING
MAY ADD MORE LATER, lol
TALKED TO LILY BILLY, need to more often

Then l stated a short gratitude for the day.  This first journal entry I was grateful for reddit, cause I believe I made a post prior to writing that entry asking for tips on how to journal.  I posted on a few mental health groups, a few addiction or drug based subs, and a few writing subs and got all sorts of helpful tips, but my first few entries remained pretty crude for a week or so.  My first entry was on 2-12-23. So I've been doing it almost daily, some days multiple times in one day, and some weeks I'll go 3 or 4 days without journaling like just recently, but I don't like doing that cause now I notice a sort of disconnect from myself when I don't journal habitually.  It's constant confirmation of all your thoughts and beliefs, and you see how your idea develop and progress.  Thinking something and thinking something then writing it down on paper, physically putting the idea into the universe helps establish it.  

I skip a week or so into my journaling and now I'm talking to it more like how traditionally people think journaling goes.  Like raw free thought sort of, that's definitely a very important part of journaling though you can and will develop your own entire journaling style based on your needs, or what you want out of it.  I thought I would hate the free thought aimless formula but it's what I use the most now, because the habit of writing allowed me to get comfortable with it and explore it's benefits.   I just moderate it by USUALLY including short term, or long term goals, gratitudes,or something. But not always, if you don't feel it you shouldnt force yourself.  You don't wanna say a bullshit gratitude just to write something for gratitude.  If you don't feel it don't write it.  So yeah fast forward in my journal and I'm talking about the day we went to the park after group and we smoked a bit and played football and frisbee and saying how nice it is, before that  some goals and gratitudes.  Short term goals.  I begin to write about accomplishments I've made and things I see different in myself.  I talk about some of my inner growth but I'll mention a specific think like in how the past year and a half I've been fucked up like 20 of those days.  Or how I feel my brain is finally begin to repair itself cause I can feel some sort of natural euphoria at times.  Dopamine release is finally becoming more regulated.  I'll write how I finished a book in a week and that's also an accomplishment.  A big accomplishment I had to write down was hygiene.  When I was in heavy active addiction, or even sober just severely crippled with depression I'd go a month without brushing my teeth, weeks without showering.  So I wrote down that accomplishment.  It effects self esteem, ego and confidence.  When you go back and read goals you had and accomplishments you've made, on a daily basis you get to physically see growth or change in yourself instead of just feeling you're doing better.  You have written proof, you're logging your mental state everyday and you go back after a month when you forget what you wrote and you're like oh shit wow, I can't believe I actually accomplished that, or shit I can't believe I even WANTED. To accomplish that.  Being able to go back and read what you wrote after you forgotten it is a visceral feeling.   Theres no real WAY to journal and I'm still figuring out my best way but it changes, some days it's free thought, one day it's lists and goals and gratitudes, sometimes a healthy mix, sometimes it's something funny that happened that day (good to go back and read on funny moments you'd otherwise completely forget about, it can immortalize them so to speak) sometimes it's topics I wanna go down rabbit holes on YouTube and I'll mention it in the journal so that if I forget I'll  come back to that page on my own at some point and remember.  I could imagine how amazing it would be to have years worth of your own personal journals now.  Must be pretty fucking cool.  Get to see huge change in yourself and never forget where you started.  Reddit gave me an overwhelming amount of GOOD information and I took what I thought would work for me, still plan to read more on journaling tips soon as I wanna evolve it further and do more for with it, but I've been doing it for a like a little over a month so ill keep learning and adding journaling objectives as I continue doing it.  All in all journaling serves to strengthen your relationship with yourself.  I know my explanation wasn't the best, so I recommend also searching reddit or Google on your own for more journaling tips that work for your needs.

"Health issue or health anxiety So before i start, let me make clear that i do have some health issue Well had, i was born with a unicuspid valve and had open heart surgery 2 years ago. Up to the surgery i was a mental wreck more than before. Now after the surgery ive been Well for the most part. I have had alot of fears after that actually got worse over the two years instead of better. Now to start This story up we gotta rewind a few months, its a few days after Christmas, im at granny inlaw having a good time, when My  girlfriend notice My right ankle is a little swollen above the achilles tendon, we call the emergency eoc and he wants ud to Come in, he frels it and want it scanned with ultrasound. It was fine. Now i didnt Think much of it then, but im sure My ankle above the achilles always was swollen but i havent ever really looked much at My ancles.
Now here is where it gets difficult two days later we Are home, i wake up and notice i have a coin sized point bit left from My sternum with minor pain,and I get spells of dizziness.
At night i get admitted to the ER and they do ultra sound, ekg, bloodwork work etc. And everythings fine, except from slightly elevated troponin which could be scar tissue, though they think i have a minor infection in my heart and release me sayinf i should be fine sfter some time but i dont feel fine. Onde home i get This feeling  of not being able to get enough air when I breath. A week later im back in the ER, they do the  usual checks plus a ct and guess what, im fine except for the same slightly elevated troponin and they release me Again sayings its just a minor infektion. 
3 weeks later i have an appointment with a specialised cardiologist that is educated for valve disease and has byen following me for over a decade. She checks me and im fine My heart is in a good condition. Now i didnt feel happy when told so, but extreme dissapointment, i started to get a feeling of fear of Them having made a mistake or missed something . The reason being is that before My surgery the hospital i was in the ER at, didnt see that My heart wasnt doing Well when I was in for chest pain(wasnt a heart attack, but My valve failing badly) the Same pain i have Now. 
Now i startede going to a psych every third week and its good. But at this point im uncertain of what is wrong, ive been checked at the hospital 3times and at a specialized cardiologist, and they havent found much that could explain the pain.
So im trying to accept the fact it could be anxiety driven, but the moment i started trying it, i got issues with breathing Again. Its like something in me wants to keeper me in pain and afraid.

"Feeling very lonely Today I saw a Snapchat of around 6 coworkers having a bday party for my other coworker, who I considered a friend.

"Being up north in a cabin in the woods, snow and pines all around. Alone, trees and mountains all around. Alone. Crossing the room, the floorboards creaking under foot, the weight of my footprints are one last mark alive on this earth. The cold wind hitting the walls of the outside. Pulling a handgun out from the drawer in the corner. Placing it in my mouth, or on the side of my head? on my temple? whichever way it is with full intentions to pull the trigger. Am I really meant to stay alive? Was told to stay alive, but for what? Only to create more misery? The ones who have said it disappeared in the wind. To stay alive to not exist? To live only to wish to end this misery, wishing to end this thing called living? We all meet the earth in our deteriorating bones eventually. I have no legacy. I will be forgotten like the ones before me. I think these things as I am pressing the ball of the barrel to my temple. I think of him, who first said to me to stay alive even though he disappeared and said to never call back. Why am I still here? I want to cry, to scream to take this pain away. Am I really going to give in to living or just end it all? TAKE THIS PAIN AWAY! End MY MISERY! I lower the gun and fold into a ball. The gun lay at my head, the gun laying in full sight. I stare at it, conscious of the outside, the wind shifting frame of this cabin. I close my eyes and pray I no longer want to be alive. To fall asleep. To wake up alive. I want to die!

"i’ve had a rough week :/ this is literally just me going to vent bc i don’t have anyone rn and i feel like talking to a community that knows what i might be going through is more comforting than talking to people who i know aren’t going to get it or will worry them. 

so last Thursday my friend and I got into a big fight over me not answering my phone , the jist of that is i was called selfish and told i throw a pity party for myself every time I talk about my relationship with my mother ( it’s bad and has only gotten worse as im am adult now ) as well as her insinuating that i undermine their relationship with their parents ( which i do not , because that is not the type of person i am for whatever that’s worth ) and it ended with us blocking each other which is something i initiated bc I couldn’t deal with how uncommunicative she was being it alone interfered with a lot of other plans, like us going to prom together so now im torn about even going to that since it’ll be my senior prom but then the idea of being outside is to much 

so that Monday was my birthday and I had invited two other friends of mine , one of which I was supposed to be moving in with and had been planning to do so for years only for her to tell me the night i turn 18 that she doesn’t see it being realistic , which is fair and I’m not angry with her but it just seems like my life is falling apart , and I know in the future this won’t even matter but i am having borderline suicidal thoughts and can feel my depression getting so ugly that I can’t even look in mirrors or think about my future. 

i feel really lost and I’m trying to stay positive and have my perspective be that of gratitude but I’m struggling and im just so fucking scared about what I’m going to do in my life. I was thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend but I can’t even trust that the thought is mine or just my brain going into overdrive. I can’t even look people in the eye anymore . I just want to sleep and I want to run away and just go somewhere but I know that’s my avoidance talking. 

don’t really know why im posting this , i think maybe I want to hear about your stories of overcoming things and getting to where you are now or just to know somebody else understands.",Bipolar,"{""category"": ""Suicidal""}",2025-04-21 02:49:50.353303,e5-large-v2
"I hope this makes you feel better Society expects us to have kids, house, nice car and a “successful” career to be “happy”.

We’re brainwashed into following this “dream” right from school and put ourselves through great deal of stress pain and suffering.

Unless you’re born into wealth you have to give your life away and work for someone else’s dream with the tales that one day you will have the same amount of wealth and along the way you’re reminded how far away you are and compare yourself to others that have just that bit more than you.

You sacrifice your life, freedom, health, relationship all for some pocket change and a supposed wealth while others are milking from your sacrifice this making you feel like a failure, feeling like that dream is further and further away.

It’s a mindset you need to teach yourself, a mindset where your head is clear and at every obstacle you need to tell yourself no matter what it is that you’ll be fine because LIFE IS TOO SHORT AND CAN CHANGE IN AN INSTANT and then when your health suffers all of these aspirations and dreams do not matter.

I’ve been incidentally diagnosed with cancer - was very lucky as they’ve cut it out fairly quickly, only 3 nights in hospital, painless procedure. I’ve won a lucky dip with life because it was nothing, but seeing people who care about me being so upset was a horrible experience.

I wanted them to be happy and stop worrying because I’ve never thought much of myself then why would they? Because I am nothing, I am not worth anything, low self esteem, never had any aspirations, goals, only liked cars, wasn’t very social, couldn’t really talk to people and sat in my own head alot.

Showing how much those close to me cared for me made me change. When I lay in hospital my head was clear, didn’t worry about work, buying a house, savings or career. Only my family mattered and that’s how I’ve learned this mindset and began adapting my life around it, got rid of as much finance as I could, paid off my phone, sold the BMW bought a cheap Fiat for cash. Financial freedom helped with not worrying about money. Began saving money for a deposit for my new house in the future.

I keep reminding myself to enjoy the little things in life, going for a walk, going to a gym or even buying something fancy to eat here and there on my weekly shop, going restaurant and getting a carbonara or a new phone case. I’ve started eating healthy and looking after my health. I feel happy, proud of myself and I live week by week.

Of course I am aware I am very lucky and not everyone has the same opportunities in life and do not wish to upset anyone by this post. I hope this helps someone to find their path in life.",Stress,"{""category"": ""Normal""}",2025-04-21 02:49:59.408196,e5-large-v2

They broke up for 2 months around 2017, a little before her suicide attempt, then they resumed their relationship. He broke up with her yesterday and she tried to take her life. She called me crying and sobbing loudly from the hospital yesterday. She told me that she told him he did not want to be with her anymore. She basically crumbled. Her mom called me today and told me that she tried to take her life but they found her in time. I really dislike the boyfriend, if I am honest, I have never been a fan of him. Hes always seemed off to me, distant. But as her friend I always made the effort to support her decision to be with him. Right now she is still hospitalized and crying inconsolably. Her psychiatrist is traveling to where she is (she is out of town, about 18 hours driving away). I feel really sad that i cannot be there for her and her mom. I do not know how to continue to support her. I want to be there 100%. I have never been depressed so I do not know how to approach it.

I feel like I'm restricted and couldn't act my true self when I'm with them maybe because I'm afraid of being disliked by them? I'm not really sure and I'm still learning and knowing about myself.

"Friends Is it normal to constantly worry about my actions around my  friends?

I [M] started worrying about whether my friends, or at least my general ones, were just about putting up with me. I feel as if I am unwanted around people I consider friends. Conversations seem to start with being lightly involved ( since I'm present at the start) and seem to be directed at other people, say I was with 2 others they would talk between themselves. 
I may be overreacting which is probably the case but it seems when playing football during breaks at school, I seem in no way involved like my other friends are.
People I like as friends seem to disregard me in most things, for example if I had a group project of some description with groups of 6, I seem to be the 7th person constantly.

I also feel that I do not want to let go of my friendships, how rough it may be on me, due to me having no other people to turn with.
I don't want to be alone, that seems like a bad life to lead but again it appears that sometimes, for others sake not just mine, me distancing myself from them would not be bad.

This does tie into r/stress in a way that I am not myself but the person others want me to be, constantly aware of my actions, hardly any of them I would do of my own accord. It is sometimes tiring.",Stress,"{""category"": ""Anxiety""}",2025-04-21 02:53:16.394948,e5-large-v2

"Advice I’ve been dealing with some anxiety issues my whole life. I’ve had lots of trama and was diagnosed with ADHD as a young child. Never being able to focus and always the most loud and distributive( in school). I used to stay up at night as a kid because after watching the slightest scary movie I would be afraid. Anyways the point of the backstory is to give you a sense of who I was. Lately within the past year my anxiety has been through the roof. I find it very hard to focus and have lots of thoughts at once. Even some that just pop into my head. I can hear other peoples tone of voice. Not like big conversation. My anxiety was so high I was getting lots of physical symptoms heart palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath to which I thought I had a heart problem. So I went to the doctors and got all the tests and didn’t believe my heart was fine until I got the results. I thought about this everyday. To which now I think this might had been a delusion. My point is I’m very worried I’m developing Schizophrenia. My family does have a history of mental health issues.I know this post is confusing and if I’m worried about my mental health I should see a doctor. But I’m just looking for advice.

"Is this normal psych hospital procedure? A few years ago on my 16th birthday I was sent to a psych hospital and stayed there for a week. Some things happened there that scared me and I'm not sure if it was standerd psych hospital procedure and I'm overeacting, or if their procedures are abnormal. I was voluntarily admitted due to bipolar disorder. I wasn't on the medicine I needed, and since it was an emergency, I went to the psych hospital. During my time there they had a skin check. At first I didn't know they were doing, they just told me to undress myself and be naked. They didn't ask if being naked in front of other people made me uncomfortable, they didn't ask if I was menstruating,  they didn't ask if I had been sexually assaulted. I was confused and thought they were going to sexually assault me, so I started crying. They then told me either I undress myself or they would restrain me. By then I was crying uncontrollably. I begged them to not make me undress myself. I let them touch under my clothes because I didn't want them to see my breasts. They forced me to take off my underwear which was uncomfortable since I was menstruating. It probably doesn't seem like much to be scared of, but when the only person you've allowed to see your private parts is your pediatrician due to yearly check-up and that it is required, and I have had the same pediatrician for several years so I trust her, it was a big deal to me. I was stuck at the hospital for a week, they said they would let me home on Friday but then said I had to stay over the weekend even though the insurance didn't cover weekends, so the hospital bill put my family in some debt. My family can afford a house, food, utilities and all that, but we aren't middle class, we get free lunch at school and help from the government. Hospital bills are notoriously high in the united states, and the medicine I'm on costs more in the united states than it does in third world countries and the developing world. My parents asked that I be released from the hospital, but their request was denied even though I was voluntarily committed. Also, the psych hospital had zero privacy. No locks on doors, the shower curtain was clear. Everyone had a roommate, mine treated me terribly, and so I was worried she'd come in when I was in the bathroom or showering and see me. The psych hospital was tiny, it was a hallway with rooms on each side, some bedrooms, a room to eat, and a desk where a lady gave you meds. They made you go to groups, but the medicine they put me on made me super tired and knocked me out. Best sleep I've had, but it made the nurses and doctors angry that I wasn't participating in groups and instead, sleeping. Or trying to sleep, rather, since the psych hospital was so small and crowded that every little noise echoed. I often hear people say psych wards make them feel safe and calm, but my experience was far from it.

"So a few friends have told me that I have got depression and I do not want to go off of a self-diagnosis or what somebody that is not professional says. So December 30th of 2020 while I was laying in bed trying to fall asleep a feeling of loneliness and sadness came over me is the best way I could describe it and I figured by the time I wake up it would be gone, when I woke up the next morning I still felt that way and decided to get ready in the dark and on my drive up to work I did not have the radio on listening to music like I normally would, when I got to work I asked my boss which route I would be doing and I started typing in the addresses on my phone and whenever I type address is in I use voice dictation, so every time I would speak an address in that morning I kept feeling this urge like I wanted to cry and the more I kept speaking the stronger it got so eventually I started typing them in with my finger and several times before dispatch my manager walked past me and I wanted to tell him so bad that I was not feeling well mentally and that I was not all there I was so close to telling him yet I could not bring myself to do it so finally fast forward to after they dispatch us instead of telling my manager that I am not feeling well mentally I told him that I was hungover..... I felt like I would have been judged if I would have told him that I was not feeling all there mentallyAnd one more incident here recently happened where me and a friend went to a bar and on our way over there I kind of get this familiar feeling of like loneliness and sadness and when we get into the bar and sit down they ask what we want to eat and drink and I was not in the mood for anything so I did not order anything I pretty much just stared off into space while we were there and after we left the bar we walked around the little shopping center area that it was in and then before we got back to my truck there was a park nearby with two Bridges that cross over a trail so I told my buddy that I was going to go take a piss and I would be right back I walk in between the two Bridges and sit down on the embankment or whatever the hell you call that thing and then I cried for about 5 to 10 minutes for absolutely no reason whatever And the background I would say the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020 I had made plans to go play pool with a coworker and right before I got to the pool hall they Called said that they could not go so I ended up going by myself and stayed there until about 2:00 a.m. playing pool by myself realizing that I was getting more and more lonely I decided to leave and drive to the park on the way there the feeling got stronger and when I got to the park I shut my truck off and cried for about a good 5 minutes at least and texted one of my co-workers that he was better at his job than I was at mineI honestly do not know if I am depressed or just lonely, because that feeling is not always constant, it is not always persistent 24/7 I think I might have depression",Depression,"{""category"": ""Depression""}",2025-04-21 03:01:55.597664,e5-large-v2

"Hello, I want to apologize for the very low level of English I have, I am not a native English speaker. I have been diagnosed with depression and have had TBIs with a psychiatrist since 2017. It has been very episodic as it is depression that starts through trauma or PTSD. I come to seek help here because my appointments are too short and distant from each other. I am looking for advice / discussion about this, although I have done this a lot in the past and feel like I have heard it all. Currently in my life it is rather quiet. No big event for 3 weeks, things are stable at this level. In fact, I want to completely detach myself from human relationships and even emotionally from things, already that I am ultra jaded and bored by everyone (music, sport, video games, literature, animated, ...) my passions do not stimulate me not as much as before. I also have all the things that I like + my ""Madeleine de Proust"" which fall, become null or stop lately. I am an only child and have a great relationship with my parents, but having to see their health deteriorate and the fact that my mother almost died of illness recently plays a big role. I have also experienced a lot of relationship disappointments, even I have hardly experienced that. Recently I have seen the true thoughts of my rare strong relationships. It hurts me but I accepted that deep down I get too attached and that all relationships are led to an end. Time erodes them and if it is not time it will be weariness. I have heard everything at this level, I have introspected a lot, applied advice but I only come to one conclusion: I have to detach myself emotionally from things. Everything ended up going badly in my life, hope made me suffer and I literally have no purpose in life anymore. I do not feel like killing myself, but I am tired and jaded with life. Literally everything is bad, everything sucks and it does not even make me want to try something new because things go wrong every time. Level of relationships, in love it is too complex and it causes more problems than good things and in friendship I believe that the true friendship that we see in the works does not exist. I have a strong relationship but I think I got too attached and I make the same mistakes over and over. In short what do you think?

"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",Depression,"{""category"": ""Normal""}",2025-04-21 03:03:57.754313,e5-large-v2

"I do not even know what to write, i just feel very sad, angry and frustrated about the limitations of my very small brain. I have always been the stupider of the group and since i was a kid, people always have made fun of my intelligence. My family, the friends i used to have, the teachers and pretty much everyone that had the displeasure of knowing me, they all naturally converged to the acknowledgement of my own stupidity (i do not even know if this sentence makes sense in english... if not, i am sorry about my poor english.). I am actually surprised i somehow managed to live for 24 years but i hope that soon, my stupidity will succeed in what it is supposed to succeed: kill the bearer of the bad genes. But you know, i am too stupid for that like i am too stupid for many others things. In the shitty life i lived, I have always had to confront with my very limited intelligence every single time i tried to do something. I used to love history but i had to give up because my brain could not afford to retains all that informations, i used to love playing piano but i had to give up because my brain could not afford the ability to perform polyrhythms, i used to love drawing but had to give up because perspective was too complicated for my brain to be handled... I could go on with a very long list of things i tried to do but miserably failed because of my very low iq. Because that is what is all about in the end.

Where you cannot understand how the hell works the world you are living in? Should i just go on with money and just forget how unlucky i was at birth? Should i just accept a life of complete ignorance?

"Hi all, I relate deeply to a lot of the posts I see on this page and I would like to offer some encouragement.There was a long period of time where I was in complete isolation and the pandemic further isolated me. I turned to negative things to cope with the depression and loneliness like mind-numbing television, alcohol, and hanging out with people that were toxic for me due to the fear of being alone.After years of therapy and growth, I wanted to share some words of encouragement for all my lonely hearts out there &lt;3* Being afraid of being alone is totally normal.* The reason you may feel so alone is because you are not sharing with anyone your feelings. You are not being seen/heard in the way you need to be seen/heard. I hope this post helps you connect in some way to know that you are not alone and many others have gone through the same/similar thing.* Growing love and respect for someone else requires time spent with that person. Over time, you may fall in love or grow great respect for people that show you who they are, what they value, how they talk/act, etc. what is the difference between that and growing self-love &amp; self-respect? You must spend that time with yourself to grow that love and respect for yourself. Alone time can be seen as an opportunity if we look at it this way.* To feel less alone, meditating for 5 minutes a day, journaling, and shadow work exercises can help you. A shadow work exercise that really helped me (that I learned through my spiritual journey/therapy) is to look at yourself in a mirror and ask yourself questions - you will be surprised what comes out.* Start some hobbies, anything and everything that you can afford to do. If it ends up flopping, that is okay. You can move onto the next thing and remember, you have time.* Over time, you will hopefully realize that time alone gives you the opportunity to do what you want, recharge, and protect your energy from people.* We are quick to defend others when they are talking negatively about themselves e.g. your friend says ""I am so ugly"" or ""I am so fat"" or ""I am so worthless"" - we immediately tell them they are not and give them a plethora of compliments to negate it. But when we are doing negative self-talk, we just feed into that and feed into that. You must be kind to yourself, you must defend yourself. Tell yourself you are having a bad day and know that it will get better.These are just some things that have helped me along my journey of feeling very lonely. I hope some of these things help you &lt;3TLDR; I have a YouTube video regarding these topics that I go into further. In my video, first I tell you my story, then I go into the pros/benefits of spending time alone, and then I finish with some friendly suggestions on what you can do alone. You can find my video by searching ""kelly guidance how to stop feeling alone spiritual chat.""You are never alone. I am sending you all so much love and light. Remember to always be kind to yourself and others. One day at a time.

"I have fucked everything up and let it go on so long it is irreparable. I can barely handle day to day life as it is I cannot even imagine trying to fix things on top of it. there is absolutely nothing that brings me enough joy in this world to make up for all the stupid bullshit we have to put up with just to exist. Nothing I do ever ends up making a difference. Every attempt to improve myself has left me worse off than before. I tried to go to college, that just led to me getting bullied like a bad teen drama. I worked so fucking hard and went so far out of my comfort zone and my professors did not give a shit. None of them remember me, I cannot get any references and I have not gotten a job in over 2 years of looking. I just spent three years and $16000 in absolute misery.I tried to improve my relationship with my family. But everything I do they see through a negative lense. No matter what I do, they manage to spin it so that I come out selfish, spoiled and lazy. I tried to improve my figure by working out, but now I am just skinny in places I need fat, fat in places I need to be skinny, and have unfeminine muscle mass in random places. And surprise surprise, it did not shrink my massive ribcage or reduce my hipdips or help straighten my spine. I tried hair removal, now I have unsightly strawberry legs and the hair grows back funny. I started moisturizing and wearing sunscreen, but the damage is already done so it just leaves me looking like a greasy pig. I tried taking birth control to help cope with my period, but it made it worse. And when I went off it, my boobs shrunk. I was already barely an A cup. And losing what little volume I had in the front just accentuates my kyphosis. I have always been ugly but I look so much worse, you would think I would let myself go rather than finally start taking care of myself. I am embarrassed to run into people I used to know. And it is only going to get worse with age. I am so fucking anxious about ageing. Knowing how much uglier I have steadily become over just the past 5 years, I cannot imagine what 40+ more will do.I cannot be happy living alone. I have tried but it is just too easy to spiral when there is no one to distract you. And you feel so isolated. I know if I ever committed to living alone, I would just give up completely. I will not get any sleep, then I will be too anxious and apathetic to go to leave the house, so I will just lie in bed and stare at my phone, while leaving the house gets harder and harder, and I will end up starving to death. But a relationship is not an attainable goal for me. Straight men hate my guts. They pointedly ignore me at best. Even if someone is desperate enough to give me a shot, they will never like me. I am too repulsive and awkward and cringey and annoying. I have no prospects in life. I am pretty much just bumming around my parents house til they get sick of me and kick me out.

"I have recently looked into reddit and found that this place is actually quite healthy and supportive... I did not know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...I do not think I have much to say, but I look very young for 26 and it seems that is a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened, I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that did not require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story does not sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I do not have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations, but I do not have a circle of friends that is interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or self-promoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I do not promote? Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free, but it is quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason, I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like that is a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways, I do not really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anti-capitalist/materialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk, you would not be ghosted. End: I really do not like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I cannot see that these people are actually hurting inside, but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar.

"Is it good to only focus on 1 goal? What I mean is, for example I have these goals:

1. Find a good job OR start and grow a succesful company
2. Find the one who will marry me in the future
3. Find out which religion is the true one / read the whole bible

So my idea is, I will only work towards one goal at the same time. If I choose goal 1 and I choose to study or gain work experience, then I will not read the bible and I will not be on dating apps, because I should not overwhelm myself and risk a burn-out. If I choose goal 2, I will be very busy with dating apps and alternatives, but I will not have a job and I will not be studying. If I choose 3, I will read the bible a few hours every day, but I will not do any other productive things.

What is the good side of this by my own thought?

1. Whichever goal is the most important one, OR has to be completed the fastest, can get priority and full focus :)
2. By only having one thing to work on, you have less risk of ending up with 0 free time, so you can avoid burn-out and instead, work at your own pace. (careful: do not get lazy)

What is the bad side of this by my own thought?

1. Spending hours everyday on the same goal only, can become boring. Some goals also do not require many hours every day: for example going to the gym. Being in the gym for 5 hours is a terrible idea, so if you have goals that require less time per day, you can actually pick 2 or 3 of these goals to fill your day.
2. Some goals must be worked on at the same time. For example, you should not avoid studying because you're too busy with going to gym. But while you study, going to the gym is still important for your health. So I would call this an exception to this ""1 goal only"" idea.

These days it seems socially acceptable that people do 3 things at the same time: study, have a job, have a social life. Where's the free time to relax? Right it doesnt exist, and even worse, sometimes all these activities take up more than 24 hours a day, which results in someone being overwhelmed and getting behind on everything. Actually this is what I have experienced. Its not a theory, it is very real.

I have a burn-out. I have been stressed 24/7 for a really long time, because I was focusing on too many things at once. I had to get my homework done, I had to spend all my free time on dating apps, I had to go to gym, etc, I had no free time left.

So my plan is to only work on one goal at once, and spend all free time as actual free time, to relax or enjoy it.

"I think I am depressed. I decided to type out and share some of my feelings and thoughts in order to get them off my chest and to hopefully receive some helpful advice or encouraging words from one of the people reading this.I was raised as a Christian and I was a believer until my early teenage years. Then, a relative of mine passed away, very suddenly, from cancer. She was still in her thirties. It made no sense to me. She was a very generous, sweet, hospitable, warm and loving woman. It made me question if there is a god and why he would allow something like this to happen to such a good person. The death of my relative turned me into a bit of a hedonist. My reasoning: Why would I do tedious things, if something like this can happen to anyone? What is the point in studying for a boring test when I could die tomorrow? I knew that the chances of me dying were slim, but there are never guarantees.Then, I identified as an agnostic atheist for a few years, before I finally became an atheist a few years ago. I am now at a point where I believe our existence is merely a coincidence. We are just descendants of monkeys on a tiny blue rock and the unfortunate tragedy is that we can reflect on our own existence. I am the kind of person who tries to make sense of everything. I usually try to be as unbiased as possible and to use facts in order to form my opinion. That is why it is so hard for me to come to terms with the fact that life is very unfair and random.By making smart choices (living healthily, working hard, etc.), you can only increase your chances of living a good life, but there are no guarantees. Our 1 and only life is a game of chance, which is a truth that is hard for me to fathom.The state of the world pisses me off too. Why the fuck is there still racism? Why are LGBTQIA+ people still being treated unfairly? Why are we allowing capitalism, overconsumption and greed to completely destroy our planet? Why are there billionaires? Why are millions of people starving, while others care about buying the latest clothes and gadgets? How am I supposed to care about school when these problems still exist? Perhaps I am just a sensitive little bitch, idk.Speaking of being a bitch, I fucking love my parents and I cannot stomach that someday, they will die. I start crying even just thinking about losing them at some point in the future. I genuinely believe they are some of the best human beings on the earth. I have thought about suicide but I do not think I would be able to do that to my parents, who are my everything. So the harsh reality is that either I will lose them, or they will lose me. So, if I do not want to commit suicide, it is inevitable that I will lose my parents at some point (if I manage to live that long) and that I will have to continue to live life on a planet full of greed and hate. A life that is inextricably linked to suffering. I have heard people say time and time again that life IS suffering, but even when that is seen as a universal truth, that does not mean that it becomes easier to accept that truth. That truth does not suddenly become easier to bear.I have briefly read about Camus (and the myth of Sisyphus) and while I agree with his worldviews and the absurdity of life, I cannot really see myself following the example of Sisyphus. I cannot see how I could accept having to roll the boulder up the hill for the rest of my life.For a few years, the idea of building a legacy intrigued me. What if I could make art or start institutions that could stand the test of time. My name would be cemented in history. Then, I had a shocking realisation. When I die, I will not be there to enjoy the legacy I built. I do not know what to do. I still enjoy sports, hedonism and other forms of escapism, but only because they allow me a temporary escape from life's inherent suffering. Perhaps I am a 'pussy' or a 'coward' but I honestly cannot take it anymore. This existence is overwhelming.

"So far I have a referral pending to an outpatient program where I can hopefully get my diagnosis reevaluated. I was originally diagnosed with depression two years ago but that is when I was in a major depressive episode I was depressed for around two years. Now I am realizing that all my life I have been having severe mood swings and sometimes that is what causes me to attempt. I am getting serious about the outpatient program this time and I am making sure to keep a log of all my mood swings and symptoms for an accurate diagnosis. But now, what can I do in the meantime for self care?**here is the story: \[ TRIGGER WARNING \]**Last Thursday I started drinking alcohol around midnight, then woke up in a dissociative state (completely sober) and attempted to hang myself. I tried once and failed, then I cleaned my room for hours before trying again. I called a crisis line and they called me an ambulance.Still in the dissociative state I walked out of the hospital in the gown and no shoes, I got about half way home before someone called the cops on me. I was so detached that I could not feel the pain in my feet. But when I got back to the hospital I realized that my feet were swollen to the size of a melon and I had blood blisters so large I could hardly walk.I have dissociated before but this time it was severe. It looked like in the movies when you see out of a characters eyes (or POV footage) and even now thinking back on it, it does not feel like it was me who walked out of the hospital.I lied and said that I was still drunk when I walked out, and the psychiatrist on duty gave me the option to be admitted or to go home. I chose to go home, and now I am feeling lost, ashamed and embarrassed about what happened.

"TLDR; bf is getting more depressed over time. I am trying so hard to get him the help he needs. I am getting pushed away and its affecting my mental health now. I feel like everything is pointing towards us breaking up.we have been dating for about 1.5 years. I have GAD and moderate/mild depression. I am currently on medications and in therapy. He has severe depression (and anxiety I suspect), and has been in therapy before. Hes going back to therapy, but there were not any availabilities until August. He has a history of getting depressed in relationships (previous two gfs and me).He and I have similar histories. Both our families had pretty nasty divorces. Both of our mothers developed cancer while we were still young teenagers. Our families are in similar geographic regions. We both had a relationship that was emotionally abusive. I guess I mention these because it was easy for us to understand each other when we first met, but also because I think these could have impacted our mental developments and relationships.Both my partner and I are in graduate school. He has a major exam coming up that determines if he will qualify for candidacy. This exam has been looming for a while and has been pushed back a couple of times because of COVID, but also because he was not prioritizing preparing for it. This stressor is contributing to his depression.The other stressor is our relationship. Its been on the rocks for a couple of months now. He left to visit family in May and he was not in the mood to have sex when he came back. I miss the sexual intimacy, but I am much prefer physical affection and emotional intimacy. Having said that, its always been hard for him to open up to me. In June, he did something that really upset me at the time, which started his spiraling. I have since forgiven him, but I do not think hes forgiven himself. He admitted hes been depressed for a while now. I did not see the signs very well and attributed it to stress from his exam (before I knew our relationship was also stressing him out). He said a lot of self-hate things and started punching himself in the face. I called his dad and told him what is going on because I felt like I could not be his only support. we have been in limbo (how he described it) since June. We did not see each other much the first couple of weeks because we both needed space. After that, I have been the one initiating contact and hanging out to get a feel for things. we have been telling we love and miss each other still. However, he told me this weekend that the physical affection is hurting him and he was not comfortable with me going to our mutual friends because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. For 4th of July, he also did not act like my boyfriend.This really hurt me but I have been trying to listen to his needs more because of his depression. Hes asked for more space to focus on school, which also hurts but I do the same when I need to get work done. I have tried to get him into our schools counseling between now and his regular therapist, but he does not want to talk to a new therapist. I have also tried to get him to couples therapy. He said he would go, but its obvious he does not want to be there, so I have not scheduled anything because I do not think it would be productive if he does not want to be there. I have asked if I can help him around his house because he is not taking care of himself. I have asked how can I support him, which was the space mentioned above.He does not know what he wants in regards to us. I do not know if its the depression talking. Hes scared if we have an on and off relationship that I will eventually leave him for good because an ex did that. Hes thinks I am disappointed in him (I have never said this, he sets these expectations for himself) because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. I feel he does love me because 1) friends and his family have told me he loves and cares about me very much, 2) he showed it through his actions before all of this, 3) he told me he loves making me happy. But, my doubts have been creeping in. He said his depression is getting worse. He does not want to see me, I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I cannot tell him how this is affecting me without him spiraling, and I just feel like I keep hurting him when I am trying my best to help him. I cannot help but think his feelings for me have changed.I love him so much for so many reasons. I loved him early on in our relationship but I wanted to be sure it was real and not infatuation, so I did not say anything until maybe 9 months in. I wish he could see what I see. But him pushing me away is hurting me and affecting my mental health now.

"Feels kind of weird posting about this on Reddit, but if it helps then I might as well.I am 16 years old, depressed, and was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome at age 6, along with being tested for autism multiple times (none of them came back, and I am fairly certain I am not on the spectrum, or at least not noticeably) and Asperger's once. I had an abusive stepfather for about 9 years, from when I was 3 to when I was about 11-12. I have just finished my GCSEs, and I am waiting on my grades. I have always been a high achiever, always been placed on ""gifted and talented"" lists, always used to bury myself in science textbooks and documentaries. Back before I had access to the Internet, my education was almost a coping mechanism. Still, now it feels like a lot of other people deserve their academix success a damn sight more than I do. Compared to a lot of people on this subreddit, I should be incredibly lucky. But I do not think my luck can be much worse. I am in a friends with benefits type relationship with a girl that I have loved for about 2 years, and we still love each other, but I used to talk to her about all of my depression and suicidal tendencies and now we have got a strict rule that I cannot talk to her about it anymore. Which tbf is for the best. That does not mean it does not hurt though. I guess my main problem is that I feel isolated almost all the time. Even in a room of people I feel like I am alone. Sometimes even when I am with her. Back when I had that abusive stepfather, I remember sitting in my room, in a corner, too afraid to leave or even move until my mum came home. I have grown up since then, but on the inside that is still how I feel. I have gone through countless friend groups who do not give a shit about me, I have only ever found three or four ""real"" friends yet I feel awful telling them about anything I have experienced or I am feeling. I tried to tell my teachers that they were putting me under too much stress, and then they decide to tell my mum, when I asked them not to. Queue me being treated like an alien for weeks. I have written countless rants, suicide note drafts, sad monologues, and it is getting tiring. The suicidal stuff gets terrifying sometimes... I have a massive fear of death, but I do not want to keep on living in this kind of world. I am not always suicidal, and to be honest today has been a really good day for me. But it is not like that makes it go away. Sometimes I am scared of what is going to happen to me in X amount of years. In fact, that is pretty much all of the time. As I get older, I start to realise that my childhood is slowly slipping away from me, and that I should probably enjoy what is left of it as much as I can, yet... I do not think I have ever really enjoyed my childhood. I am going to stop there, since I would be here for days otherwise. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

I've gotten really close with him and I am so fuckin glad I befriended him. He's really loving, kind and patient. He's assertive, out there and also very protective while I'm very quiet, meek and also generally on edge and easily spooked so he balances me out and calms me very well. I can tell he cares very deeply about me and he's accepting of my differences. I told him about my avpd and he has been very understanding and helpful.

"Male 21 years old You may not be able to understand all of this as English was not my first language.I should have lived my life happier.

Mother who worked too hard to the point where it feels like I have no parents. I got bullied when I was a kid and it made it hard for me to approach others. Even my own brother bullied me. It started when I was 8 years old. Bullying only stopped when I got to Senior High School 17 years old. Got called weird by my classmates every time. I went to different school just so I can start again but it only made it worse enough for me to attempt suicide two times. High expectation of relatives became stress and pressure for me. I had some who I should have talked to more or socialized with more but because I do not know how to, it ended with me not being able to respond making it seem like I am ignoring them and that is how I still have no friends. I always wear this fake smile on my face to not gather the attention of the teachers when I am at school. No one noticed or no one tried to ask. I tried getting help from a psychiatrist but it is not going that well. I just cannot explain why I am feeling sad or empty. I watch anime sometimes to provide myself temporary happiness but makes me feel more lonely because I have no one to talk to about things I like. I tried to befriend others but I end up talking too much and they get weirded out by me.

"I think I have bone cancer Im 20 years old (male) and im 6' 3"" 170 lbs

Let me start of by saying that for most of my life i think i have symptoms and i think im gonna die everytime untill i finally go to the doctor aand find out its some minor problem.

Ok so in spring of 2015 i noticed the muscle above my knee was twitching a lot so i got into the habit of feeling that area every day until i noticed a hard lump developing on my bone. I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.

Two years later (this last summer) i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painful/tender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.

Anyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.

My pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs  and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.

I usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds (in muscle) over the last 6 months.

What i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?

And for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town.

"This is kind of just ganna be a thought dump I guess, but its something I need to put somewhere so it is not festering in my head.I do not really understand myself anymore. I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, ""I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad"" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just 'in a mood'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that. I wonder if she would show up to my funeral. there is honestly a lot more I would like to share, but I do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so I will wrap it up. I want to see a doctor, I need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive. I want medication, BUT I cannot GET IT. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I do not want to look up how I can die painlessly anymore. I do not want to debate how much longer I want to give myself anymore. I wish I lived in Sweden or somewhere that had euthanasia, that is not as scary as a gun and a rope. I want to fix my brain.I am sorry. I know stuff like this does not really help those that feel the same, but I needed to put it somewhere. I needed to exist beyond my house.

"I cannot help to feel sorry for feeling suicidal almost every day in the past 3 years. Every day I woke up, the PTSD kicks in and it will repeat my mistake vividly. It took so much of my energy just to combat that PTSD, let alone the suicidal thought. The flashback is so real, and often leaves me with an accelerated heartbeat and a wet pillow when I wake up.I am not sure if feeling suicidal is a sure sign of depression or not. But I know that in my calm mind, that whenever the PTSD or the memory flashback kicks in, I will start to plan for suicidal methods. How I wish I can enjoy a painless death.......I know, I am sick. But I lives in a very conservative society. Suicide is a taboo topic in here and nobody would really talk about that. As a man, I know I am ""not supposed to feeling suicidal"", as this will show that I am vulnerable. I know being vulnerable is a huge weakness in this market, everyone will hits your weak point to achieve maximum benefits. I know I cannot afford to be vulnerable. I know I live in the stereotype image. Today, because of pure coincidence, I am forced to work with someone that happens to be the main character in my PTSD. She was kind, never mentioned any of my past mistakes. but before she left, she say something to me in private. This caused my PTSD and suicidal thought to be in peak. But since I am working (as a videographer), I need to display a professional image. I cannot display my personal emotion in front of client.It was only until when I am back to home and finally be alone. I slump into the bed, feeling no appetite to eat. The thought to end my life was the strongest I ever encounter. The only motivation is to seek death, so I open up my laptop, searching for any new drug that can be purchased discreetly to end my life painlessly. You know, whenever you google up suicide, there will always be a hotline number. I doubt it actually works. They will eventually say that, ""in the end you still need to rely on yourself"". I am no stranger to a suicide thoughts, and I am getting tired to all these anti-suicide campaigns. I really doubt it is helpful, especially for someone likes me that could not talk properly about my mental issue. Today is not my first suicide attempt, and I doubt it will be the last suicide attempt in my life. The PTSD and suicide leave such a permanent disability in my mental capacity. Sometimes I wish I can be dead, and sometimes where I feel so lucky not to suicide at that point. I had been trapped into this ""tried to suicide, failed, glad I am not dead"" cycle. I feel so tired and drains out to combat with these negative thoughts. I had long lost the courage to lives on. I can only use new goals to excites myself. Quite similar in dark souls, once you finish your duty, you are bound to ""die"" (literally). I am really sorry for the negativity. I am so scared to talk about this with anyone. This had been my deepest secret that I could not share with anyone. I felt really guilty that while I am feeling suicidal, there are thousands of people in the hospital who struggle to live on. How I wish I can ""transfer"" my lifespan to them..... They can just live on with my life, while I die (happily, I hope so).

I have a lot of codIm 29 going on 30, and I have a lot of issues. I have no contact with my family (my dad died in a car accident, and my grandmother of cancer. Both within a month of eachother. The rest of my family are assholes), two of my closest friends stopped talking to me because of my mental health, I am paying for an apartment I cannot afford, and I graduated recently with a degree in art where tbh, I am mediocre at best. Right now, I am waiting tables and having to fake all of my emotions every fucking day and really sell that I care about someone is lunch taking too long. I feel like I cannot really make art, or even enjoy making art, because my depression has gotten so bad. Its been so hard to motivate, and I feel like a fucking loser. I am barely sleeping. I work, I go home, I lay on the couch till the sun goes down. At this point, I cannot even listen to music or watch tv anymore because the anxiety of feeling like a worthless pos kicks in, so most of the time I just lay here and do nothing. I am really self conscious about where I am, I feel stuck, and I do not know how to get out of the hole I am in.I drink alone now. I did not even drink until about two years ago. Honestly, I do not even really like alcohol that much, it just makes the time go by and makes me not want to eat. I am uncomfortable in my body and have always wanted to be skinny and pretty, and never have been either of those things.So I stupidly and drunkenly called him, and asked what it was exactly that made him change his mind about me. He basically validated everything that I have been feeling; that I have no drive, no motivation, and that I have just gotten comfortable. I do not know why I did it, but I told him I had to go, grabbed an xacto, and cut my leg. I had to call out of work for two days because the wound was not really healing, and I did not want to go to the hospital because I am uninsured and afraid of being put on a psychiatric hold. I already have so much fucking debt. I went to work today, but it was really hard and I was in a lot of pain.I do not know what to do with myself.

"I'm so tired of trying to be okay. When I don't exercise regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to go into social settings and interact with others, especially friends, semi-regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to switch up my routine, it happens and it happens when I have no routine. It happens when I don't get enough sleep, when I don't spend enough time outside and the list goes on. It's exhausting. And while a lot of these habits/things are enjoyable in the moment, once I push past my ""but I don't wanna"" inner toddler brain, I'm so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain ""okay"".And truth be told, lately, I haven't.

"My [31] BF[36] of 1.5 year is generally quite a charismatic and positive person. He jokes around and can be absolutely charming. If you talked to him as a stranger you would never think he may be depressed, but I am starting to get seconds thoughts, and its breaking my heart.He grew up in a rich family with a lot of staff who helped the family with the house, and went to an expensive private school. Also he was the youngest sibling in his family, so he enjoyed a careless childhood.Then he studied, worked some years very successfully, met me. He had some relationships with women before me, but they were always somewhat traumatic or abusive. Now - i think - we have a very caring relationship. He has a very strong charismatic personality, he is manly, talented, very empathetic and smart. we have met about 1.5 years ago. For all this time till now his working hours were cut down due to corona, and he worked only 3 days a week from home, so he had a lot of free time. And besides working he has done all the same things for 1.5 years. He smokes, reads social media, watches series (most of them hes seen before), eats. He has insomnia. He often wakes up tired in the morning. His work is frustrating for him, but he seems to feel insecure to search for another job. Recently when i jokingly said something about an old psychological trauma of mine, he answered seriously: and my trauma was having to go to work 5 days a week. And the puzzle got together in my head today. I think that as kind in a rich family he never was taucht the concept of labor of any kind, and work is actually something really unpleasant for him. His current job is especially boring and feels unnecessary. So he never really accepted that he has to go to work, its actually a trauma, and he dreads it all the time. When he learned that he has to work 5 days again, he was glum and grumpy for a whole week. I really wish he would get therapy on the matter. But I am afraid that he would think its a sign of weakness, and that the world just works this way. That everyone has his job that much... But i disagree! I feel that something is dreading and exhausting him all the time! and i think its fear that he has to work, and he will have to do it for many more years. I love him.

I work in an urgent care and I got reprimanded. The first one was when I found a woman bleeding on the ground right outside the clinic and I went inside to get help because I could not lift her by myself. I told the PA and everyone pretty much rushed outside except me and one other person because I just got there and had to put my stuff down. But they think I completely ignored the patient and walked by them when I was the one who found her and got help. The reason I did not go with them was because someone had to keep seeing the patients. They were backed up already and there were 5 people already going outside to help her that it would have made no sense for me to go with them. They did not even try to clear things up with me. They just assumed that I did not want to help and told my supervisor which is bullshit. They think I am horrible because of a misunderstanding. And then I messed up by not putting the patient in the bed when putting an IV in. They fainted and started convulsing which could have hurt them badly if they hit their head. I know I screwed up big time and I just cannot get over it. I was going to go part time once school started in fall. But now I think I should just quit.

I will never forget the times when we huddled up crying and embracing each other while our parents fought. It did not scar me but I hate to remember those times when our parents hurled insults back at each other. Money now seems like such a waste. But anyways I want you to know that I care for you so much. I would do anything to make you feel safe. I am the baby of the family and have always felt like the black sheep. A gay man who was curse with fantasizing. My head can never shut up and I am fed up with it. No meds or therapy can take away the pain. Life is just a void of work and misery till you die. I could have a billion dollars in the bank but I know I would just be drinking eating and smoking till my inevitable passing. Die now in my prime or die after years of mental torture. I truly do not see another side to this. A final note id like to make is to my nephew Bryce. I want you to know sweety is that I have always loved you and care for you deeply. I missed those days when you under a year old and I was feeding, burping, bathing and changing you. I greatest moment ill never forget is when you had a big accident and poop was all over my arms but I want grossed out. I knew that was most important was to make sure you were safe and clean. I will never forget when I was giving you a bath in the sink and I turned to grab a rag on the floor and turn to see you peeing a fountain in the water and making eye contact with me and giggling. that is when I knew you were a special child with a great personality. Such a boy like your mother. I hope that you turn into a Warrior and not let anyone step in your way. You fight like a champion but you never throw the first fist or hurl the first insult. You are better than that. You be respectful and kill your enemies with kindness. Then ditch them to rot in the filth that is not towards you. Walk away.I love you all. Please cre mate me and throw my ashes with Koda in the ocean so we can be at peace together. I am getting lost in my hopes and dreams, I cannot see far, but I know I can see, Everything is a blur to me, But I am hoping for some visibility, I thank my God for all I have,that is why I am going to die noble, In not going to die sav,I know I need to grow up,I know I need to learn, But I feel that all of my fears, Will leave me 3rd degree burned.

"One spot on my spine feels tender, I'm worried it's cancer. I haven't been worried about my health for a while so this didn't concern me much until today.  I notice that when I hunch over, or when I press on this particular spot on my back (near where my bra strap would be) it feels like I bruised it.  It's not painful enough to disrupt my day, but it's a little disconcerting.  I started googling and I saw a bunch of people who had this and it just went away on its own or it wasn't anything, but then of course I continued googling and ""back pain"" can be cancer.  It's surface-level though, really does just feel like a skin bruise.  And I don't feel it at all if I sit normally and don't press on it.

"I have a rabies fear, can anyone help out? This all started last June, I was playing with my dog in my yard. He lunges forward and I reached out with my hand and his tooth scraped my middle finger. It did cut the skin and I was bleeding. My finger was tingling at the site where he bit me. I went to go wash it off and didn’t think much of it until I looked on the fridge and I see my dog was a week overdue on his rabies vaccine. I panicked and wasn’t sure what I should do. I know of rabies, but I didn’t KNOW rabies until my dumb mind did some googling. 

If you know where the googling is going, then you understand my fear. If you don’t, just don’t worry about it. 

My dog at the time is a 13 year old German Shepherd. He is prone to seizures and would have a couple of them a year. We’ve had him for 11 years so we know how to handle the situation. He also drooled and foamed a lot in the mouth. That was his natural way. He’s been vaccinated every year as it is required in the state of New Mexico. 

I did go to urgent care and received a Tetanus shot since I was overdue on that one but my doctor told me that it’s been over 40 years since a dog had rabies in my area. so I did not receive the rabies shots. Which made me feel better honestly. For about 5 months. 

In October, my dog was put down because he was struggling to stand up and seemed like he was in pain a lot. 

In late November, I got what seemed like a week long cold. Sore throat, tired, drained and all that junk. I was sick but not terrible so I went to a concert and I started to feel worse. For some dumb reason, the first thing that appeared in my mind was rabies. And I almost panicked because of it and couldn’t enjoy the show. I went home after feeling very horrible. I couldn’t sleep, a headache kicked in, my fever rose and it’s like my mind was repeating the same scene over and over all night long and I couldn’t sleep at all. Then I woke up around 5 am with a racing heartbeat that wouldn’t slow down at all. I felt awful and was fearful about rabies. 

Since that day, I never ignored my finger where my dog bit me. I still feel pain and a minor tingling sensation where he bit me and all I can think about is if I have rabies. It’s practically on a daily basis I look at the spot. I have no idea how to get past this. It’s been 9 months since the incident and I still worry about getting it. I just can’t shake this fear out of my mind. I thought the spot where he bit me would be gone but the area is still red as if it’s been only a couple of weeks since he’s bitten me. 

I’ve tried everything, such as logic. It’s exceedingly rare in the US, most rabies cases have been from bats in the US or contracted outside. Last person to die from a dog rabies in the US was in 1974. Basically when my parents were still kids. And I’m 25 now. My dog survived the 10 day quarantine and we vaccinated him after those 10 days just in case. 

Like I can’t shake the fear. Each time my finger is in pain or even get a tingling sensation, my mind instantly jumps to that conclusion. I almost don’t care about anything else. I have stomach pains and I’m going to see a gastroenterologist about it, I really wouldn’t care if they told me I had cancer. Rabies is just something that truly sparks fear in my mind. 

I even freak out seeing bats in the sky since I work at stadiums as a camera guy. ",Anxiety,"{""category"": ""Anxiety""}",2025-04-21 03:49:55.393480,e5-large-v2

"Definitely depression, but could there be something else too? (Thanks in advance!) I'm in my early 20's, currently a full-time student, currently seeing a counselor at my university for the depression I had from October-early February.

Some background: *Had an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive father growing up

*had cycles of depression as a teen but nothing as bad as this past fall, never before gotten treatment for it.

*used to have anger issues that I've been working on and have mostly gotten better.

*I used to be and still have worries in the back of my mind about some new super bug plague wiping out humanity, apocalyptic scenarios (before dystopian books were a thing-- or at least before it was on my radar), generally was and am irritable at times (can't stand foot/leg bouncers/tappers and gum smacking--as a result I feel pretty trapped in lecture halls). Something that also seems to stand out to me is that a year or two ago I got uncontrollably angry (literally shaking mad) at my roommate for no reason and had to go on a really long walk.

Currently: During my depressed period I had foggy cotton ball brain, couldn't concentrate, trouble sleeping and staying asleep, the irritability, suicidal thoughts all the time, racing thoughts.

Early last week I kinda started feeling better, one day everything looked more vivid. That sounds weird, but color had a touch more color, bright things were more bright. The next day I was so elated and have been ecstatic each morning. Waking up has been easy for the first time in a long time. I'm not riddled with self doubt or constantly wondering if I'm annoying people by talking to them. I'm actually excited for my future. I got cheap new clothes that fit so I don't have to wear my sweatpants every day any more.

Today I woke up early, did a bunch of errands, got more clothes, ran for the first time since September, did my usual short workout routine twice, and even went to an event at my university.

It's nice to finally be happy, but it feels wrong to be THIS happy so suddenly after having suicidal thoughts all day every day.

I meant to talk to my counselor about all this this morning but she was out sick---so instead I am asking for any personal experience or thoughts on this to see if I might be way off base or not here. ",Bipolar,"{""category"": ""Bipolar""}",2025-04-21 03:50:27.131384,e5-large-v2

"Really need help here, I have struggled with feeling this way for weeks now.For the past month or so I have had little to no motivation to do anything anymore. Even writing this post requires a tremendous amount of effort. I have plenty of things to do, but I just have no desire or motivation to do anything. Going to the gym, working out, studying, learning a new skill, cooking and eating, it all just feels boring and dull to me. Some days I will force myself to go to the gym but I end up leaving because there is no energy/motivation to get through a workout. Nothing is enjoyable, besides video games and porn, but even those two things are getting really boring and do not provide me with the same amount of satisfaction any longer.I finally figured out that a large part of this problem stems from how lonely I am. I am 35 and I live with my parents. I left my job in the military because I could not take it anymore and wanted to earn my bachelors degree. I moved back in with my parents because of the pandemic, although I will return to school in the fall. I HATE living with my father, who is even more depressed/lonely/pathetic/miserable than I am. he is an incredibly toxic person to be around, and I know once I am gone and away from him I will begin to feel better.I do not know anyone where I live. I have absolutely no friends. I looked for groups to join on [meetup.com]( but nothing really interests me. Besides, going to clubs like that just seems so strange to me. I have never had a girlfriend and never had sex. I am a good looking guy who is in great shape, but I think years of watching pornography online has really harmed/damaged my brain in some way. I have incredibly high expectations in women. I am trying to stop watching porn, but it is the only thing in my life that I enjoy and look forward to. That really hurt me to say that, but sadly it is true.The worst part about this entire situation is the amount of time I am wasting sitting here doing nothing all day. I have plenty of things I could be doing, but NOTHING interests me anymore.

Even my siblings notice the abandonment i get relating to my studies, where it has caused me to try and aim for the high not to be the best just to be appreciated by my parents.After all that was done in my country there are limited scholarships a person could apply to and with my grades i thought I could have easily got one and by this time i would have choices to pick from but because of covid my grades were insignificant because many students got their grades up by cheating. And there is one month left and I am still anxious if ill get the scholarship i desire and this has trully ruined my mood over the holidays and made me not care about many things i just would not bother to do anything it has been a long tire full journey of studying and not to get appreciated from anyone makes me depressed and starting to not even care about the foundation that i have built i studied and worked hard to excell at every part possible but i could not get the recognition i deserved either from my parents or the scholarships Trauma with studies",Depression,"{""category"": ""Stress""}",2025-04-21 03:52:36.637855,e5-large-v2
"I feel so empty and don't know who I am I don't think I know what I'm looking for here. Maybe just a place where I can spew how I'm feeling out without being afraid of creating some kind of judgment or conflict. 

I have been having a growing identity crisis lately. Once I was diagnosed, my life was based around understanding my illness. Then it was about treating it. Then it became about  maintaining it. Now that I've been maintaining it for nearly two years, I feel like I've completely lost myself in the process. 

I am on disability so don't work, live in a rural town so don't have a big social circle, and I used to get into a lot of different artsy projects, but since getting on my current med cocktail that actually seems to work, I've lost all drive and desire to be creative. I even pulled my art bag out in the hopes that I would want to pick things up and get messy...but nothing. I ended up putting it behind the end table in my living room so it is out of the way. 

I spend my days exercising, taking care of my dog, cat and husband, my house, cooking and watching tv/movies. And while I am a genuine cinephile - it's not enough; I feel so empty. Nothing about my life feels worth while anymore. I can't tell my husband before I sort this feeling out because he'll take it personally and I cannot handle that kind of conflict right now. 


I literally cried myself to sleep last night (though that was provoked because right now my husband is sick with an infection for over a week and he can get a little brash when he doesn't feel well...I try not to take it personally, because it's not personal, it just can hit the right/wrong buttons). When I was showering today I was listening to music, and the song ""Try"" came on, and when Colbie Caillat sang ""You don't have to try so hard"" I just lost it. There was no trigger this time except the song. 

I've always really been interested in and invested in politics, but the way that politics have been for the last two years, I just feel like it is adding this constant weight to my heart. I am so so sad to see what has happened to our country. Everything feels like it's getting worse and I can't see the good happening in the world, anymore. So that hobby has become a very heavy emotional weight. 


I just....I just feel empty and I don't know what to do. I don't know who I am other than a woman on disability with bipolar.

I mean BLATANT favoritism parents divorced within those 3 years. parents stole me from each other, back and forth until Social Services stepped in first foster home gave me a short glimpse of what it was like to be cared for in the first time of my 8 years of life ended up being taken out of that home after about 6 months and put into a new one new foster mother beats me regularly, sexually abused me frequently and to top it off, keeps me locked up in a basement room with no windows, no clocks, no way to tell time. Leaving me in there for days at a time. This was frequently done over a 5 year period of my life after 5 years had passed, my father got custody of me only to treat me like a ghost. He only got me back for the SSI check. Other than that, I did not exist to him pretty much in school, I was teased a lot because I was constantly in sweats, I did not have any real clothing other than that and laundry was not done on any regular basis. Their laundry was, mine was not. already extremely socially isolated, things progressively got worse up to the point of someone physically bullying me and eventually I snapped and put him in the hospital. Made me realize what a monster I was. during the last couple years of high school, I found my high school sweetheart. We were together for 7 years. We made a son together. he is currently 17, turning 18 later this year. social services got involved in my life again claiming we had failed to get our son his shots, which we had to reschedule because her grandmother had passed on the day before the scheduled shots. So there goes a year and a half of fighting the incessant demands of social services they get into her head. Tell her she does not need me. She leaves me, takes me to court for 100% custody. At that point, I did not think I could possibly be more broken. I did not have a choice, so I just gave up and within 2 months, she had taken my son to another state to pursue some internet boyfriend she met on some backwards art site D something or another. a couple years pass and I decide to try again with someone new. Started off strong but there were a ton of issues and a lot of damage left behind from my past relationship. I could never trust her. still, she got pregnant on our second time so she had not gotten a chance to see the extent of the damage in me. I wish I could have been able to tell her to just run, run away from me. I suppose in some way, I did just not in so many words. towards the end our son was delivered as a stillborn. His umbilical cord had wrapped around his neck, killing him days before he was due. Just a few days. we split ways after this. I took the loss personally, as though it was God's way of punishing me for being the monster I was. Got super suicidal and tried dozens of times to end myself. All failed, obviously. a few more years passed after and I was still stuck on this notion that I wanted a family. So naturally, I found a new relationship and moved clear across the country just to be with her. while we were in person together, things were amazing. It was like gravity, we could not stay away from each other. But when the time came to part ways... that is when things got ugly, fast. still, we managed to make it last for nearly 5 years and she bore me another son. I wanted to be there so badly and she knew I did. We had talked about several times. I got to see my son ONCE before she decided she was going to keep him from me. Even despite the fact she knew I was going to be a good father. First her, it was just easier to not have to fight her grandparents who she lived with. So that is what she did. He was born nearly 7 years ago and I have not seen him since the day he was born. after two years of fighting with her to just be a family with me, I finally broke in the worst way I have ever broken in my life. I just gave up. She was not going to change her mind ever. So I walked away. more suicide attempts and a few months later I decided a drastic change was needed inside me. So that is what I did. I pursued self actualization and personal development and started to try to deal with all thus trauma I had experienced in this life. something clicked inside, like a burner just turned on and suddenly I started thinking differently, I became different than who I was before. The original owner of this vessel was gone and I was born. I was ready to accept that I would never have my own family, but I was not ready to give up on love so I went and found a new relationship. This one was actually pretty good. I did not accuse her of cheating ever in our entire relationship. I gave her room to do her own stuff and encouraged her to take time with her son, her friends, her family. I was being a good partner for once in my life and I was open to her, open to the idea this could last, it honestly felt like it was my forever home. I let myself actually believe in that. as you may suspect, things eventually fell apart. She pulled away from me, stopped so much as even touching me and I tried to talk with her, communicate what was going on to no avail. The day we broke up, she had gone away for 5 days saying she was babysitting her sister-in-law's dog. Well, I found out that that whole story was a lie, just from a Facebook post of her sister-in-law at home with her two children, getting ready for the weekend. in the end she said it was because I was too sensitive and too difficult to love. Those words still stick with me almost 2 years later now. at this point I am completely lost about what I want anymore. I want to have that relationship that lasts but I am not sure I can trust myself to actually even try again. So what else is there for me? I could never have my family, cannot even have a secure relationship even when I have worked so hard to be acceptable and lovable. I cannot help but feel like I am just wasting time, wasting my therapist's time all in some delusion that I will ever be worthy of love.&amp;#x200B;that is just a chunk of my iceberg.

"Anxiety Over Having Made No Accomplishments in Life I'm almost 40 so my life is nearly half over and I feel like I've done nothing with it. Especially because for some stupid reason I've placed all my eggs in one basket and insisted on becoming a successful author no matter how stupid or hard or impossible it is to do that these days. I haven't even tried to date anyone in over 10 years so though I'd like a relationship, I'm socially inept and awkward. I also have a lot of baggage not just from an abusive father but from two abusive relationships I was stupid enough to get into. At my age with my history, no one wants to even attempt to deal with that nonsense and as I said I'm inept at socializing because of my own problems. I don't have a ""career"" like my siblings. I don't have a family. I don't even have a job because of a permanent disability making it almost impossible for me to work. Though I have written several novels, they more than likely will never see anything resembling profit or commercial success. Most of my days are spent playing video games, hating my life, and writing because I'm too stubborn to give up on that dream despite every single sign telling me that I'm old, it's over, and there's no way I'm talented enough to make it work. 

I know that people will say that I shouldn't measure my success by other people or people around me but let me tell you. It's exceedingly hard to show up to family functions when all your siblings are married professionals with their own houses and you are the loser who has been single for 15 years because she can't manage to get into a relationship that's not abusive and would prefer to stay at home, alone with her cat who's gonna die soon anyway because he's old. If you want to suggest therapy or medication...I've done both. Medication isn't a fix for me and I've tried it on and off for years. Therapy has been a constant in my life since I was 18 so if you can possibly imagine it I was far worse than \*this\* before now. If anything I could \*possibly\* say it's a miracle that I've come as far as I have with recovering from abuse, dealing with addiction, an eating disorder, and my anxiety issues. Yet, at the same time, I desire things that I'm 99% sure I can never have and I know I'm running out of time.

Obviously it’s linked to the fact that I’m going to apply to a PhD and the fact that he’s a very knowledgeable man in his field, and there’s probably a bit of impostor syndrome playing.

"I am going to share with you something that has always cheered me up and calmed me down whenever I get really anxious over my health So this sub only seems to really have posts from users describing their symptoms and trying to get diagnosed on Reddit, now if that helps you with your anxiety that's cool, however it can be counter intuitive as the whole googling and obsessing over symptoms is the actual problem we all came here to rid ourselves in the first place. So I honestly do believe we should move more away from ""I have x,y,z symptoms am I going to die?"" to ""How can I find peace of mind and stop googling"" 


One thing I do to get peace of mind is watch this episode of [Hey Arnold](https://www.wco.tv/hey-arnold-season-2-episode-5-monkey-business-2) which is my all time favourite show (it's only the first episode in the video provided called 'monkey business' btw), I won't ruin it for you all, but it's really funny and will hit home for all of us, it highlights how silly we can be sometimes when we think we have a really bad illness and start obsessing over symptoms.

"Ketamine Therapy So the other day I'm on the net and I see an ad for a ketamine clinic that promotes it for bipolar, but provided no information. I requested the science to support their claim, and sent it to a scientist to back up what I had read. Thid scientist was also part of the DC ketamine trials and helped analyze the information. We were of the same mind. Good in theory, but no real science to support their claims. With MDD and PTST sure, but bipolar is a different kind of beast. Anyways I get a call from the doc that runs the cliinic. We talk for about 15 minutes and I get all my questions answered. They claim an 80% success rate. That seem super high for me. Also insurance doesn't cover it so it would all be out of pocket. I am a prime candidate, but I'm not going to pay money to be a lab rat, especially if there's a 20% failure rate. I would mean regular maintenence doses and stopping meds, which scare me.

Even though I still have some AvPD traits that I’m still working on, my therapist says I certainly no longer meet the diagnosis of AvPD.

I’ve gone from being a textbook AvPD with such bad social anxiety I barely left the house an could barely order a cheeseburger.
All through school people called me “socially retarded” and my mom thought I was autistic.
To now being a very socially skilled, confident, outgoing person who makes friends easily.

I’m curious if people are interested in some kind of a write up about how I’ve recovered from my AvPD, what helped me, how long it can take etc?

I see a lot of people struggling and feeling hopeless on this board.
It breaks my heart when I see people truly believe that recovery is impossible (and spreading that false message). It is possible! It’s just really hard, uncomfortable, takes a lot of time and you have to really want it.

Thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of? I’m also open to suggestions of what else could help.

P.S. I feel vulnerable writing this post in fear that people will have an angry, skeptical reaction or think I’m being narcissistic.

My brain also feels non-responsive and i am only on autopilot.

My body feels like stone. Too light. Nothing dragging it down causing a heavy feeling making it be my own. My arms feels so strange. It feels like I am not in my body. It is so mechanical. 

I dont sleep because i dont Feel sleepy. I never Feel calm in my body, just an unnerving neutral and restless feeling.

I want to Feel, but there is nothing in my body. When i am sad and angry i just know, because there is nothing in my body. No surge of rage and no pain in my chest. 

When i lay down under my covers, i dont get a familiar calm and warm, heavy feeling in my body. It is still hard as stone on the inside.

Also i dont Feel hunger. And never sleepy in my head. I also dont Feel confused in my head or get a foggy feeling. Even though i know that is what i am. 

I also never get a feeling associated with a place or memory. When i think of a memory i get no spontanious emotion connected to it. 

Like sitting on the terrace with a nice cup of tee, early morning walks, sitting down on the couch after a hard day of work. Never get these feelings in my body. Also the feelifn of autimn, friday, christmas. All gone. Cant even remember them in my mind because i cant Feel with my brain. 

All emotions are purely mental. Sometimes my brain is so numb though it does not respond to any stimulus. And i have this constant unsatisfactory feeling because nothing makes me Feel.

All i have left is stress in my body. Nothing else. This bad restlessness i cant get out of.

It feels like so bad!

"not sure about what to do with my life. For the past 4 years I've (18m) struggled with depression, I guess it started with the very turbulent divorce of my parents (a violent fuckfest) when I was 14yo in 2019, it was at that time that I started doing drugs such as mdma, lsd and cocaine, however I'd say my drug consumption really started as young as 12 given that I would abuse my adhd medication (ritalin) by snorting it.
Later down that year I had some pretty shitty moments with my mother (physical violence) as my father abandoned us to go live in another country for half the year, when he came back, they found out about my drug usage, which again ended up in physical abuse and the over infantilization of a 15 yo boy who never had any freedom or power in his life, my parents started walking me to school (it was 2 blocks away from home lmao), once they even punched me infront of my classmates and threatened some random boy about beating him up because they confused him with someone I smoked weed with.
At the end of that year they sent me to love with my grandma in another country.
There I was, all alone in a country that was foreign to me although I was born there, I had family of course, but I can't really be myself around my family, the year was 2020 and I was just starting classes again when the pandemic hit, it was at that point when I abandoned my studies for the first time, tbh I didn't suffer through covid because I lived with my cousin and we played videogames all day, but I ended up drinking a ton of alcohol in secret again, sniffing gas from the stove, stealing pills from my grandma, because I was desperate, life felt like it physically weighted on me,
I stopped eating because sadness did not allow me to, I started getting weaker and weaker untill 10onths later my mother picked me up and we returned to tje country I was raised in.
It did not get better for a long time.
My mother did not trust me at all and didn't allow me to go outside (I was 16 at the time), she even hid the keys from me.
As I realized that she would never trust me again I said fuck it and started smoking weed again, yadda yadda I start studying again and pass the year (yay), but still, I was a 17yo boy who isolated himself for 2 years and didn't talk irl to anyone that wasn't family, I developed a serious internet addiction due to it.
In 2022 stuff got slightly better, but not really, during summer break I met a girl (26yo) online, and we start talking, we like each other, the first time I left my house in years for something that wasn't school was to meet her, which I did, at the cemetery, I was 17.
Later in that year I get into an altercation with my mother and she beats me again and kicked me out of her house, after that I live with my father for a couple weeks before she decided to ask me to come back home again (she never said sorry), I get even more depressive to the point I abandon my studies again.
Then I become 18 years old, and this 26yo girl I talked about before asks to unvirgin me (to which I said yes), she invited me to her brother's bday party.
When everyone went to sleep, we were in bed together, I was sleepy and high, and she was drunk and coked tf up, we had a very awkward kiss, I then say that I forgot to bring condoms and she mounts me anyway before I could say anything.
After that shitty experience we become a couple, my first girlfriend ever yay.
Fuck it was a rollercoaster of shit, she was abusive, she offered me coke after I was clean for 3 years, she insulted me and said I was only useful for sex, she even slapped me a couple of times.
Why does everyone abuses me?
Now, 2023, I have my first job, but I still struggle with my weight, which makes me very self aware of how weak and small I am.. I feel ugly, I feel emasculated.
Now I have to study again and I just can't keep up with study and work (my work shift goes from 4am to 12pm, and my classes go from 6pm to 12am)
I just want to give up, I feel like I don't deserve anything, I just want to sleep and sleep and wake up when everything's allright.

"4 years ago I wasnt showering for months at a time, depressed, anxious and paranoid. At the time I was sober going on 18, 19 years. I was, and am on disability since 09' for schizoaffective bipolar type disorder. 

For the longest time, especially since sobriety, I've been overwhelmed with thinking. Space, time, behavior, tornadoes...whatever. 

But, since my life was an unmanaged train wreck I had no confidence in myself as having any quality. It seems that feeling good about yourself comes from a well managed life.   


My last job was as a janitor on the army base near by roughly 5 years ago. I couldnt handle the pressure. I was so dependant on others for everything I was asking if I was sweeping properly. Very bad mindset. A lady mentioned crying and it made me feel like crying. I didnt understand how that could be. It seemed like witchcraft, so to speak. That was my last day at my last job. It was my 4th attempt to go back to work since my disability badge acquisition! 

I've been in therapy for 16 or 17 years ago I got into therapy from a mental health episode. During that visit at the crisis stabilisation unit in Virginia (Fredricksburg) I met a man that changed my life. He went by the name Bose Uncle. He taught me a breathing exercise. 3 in 6 out. You breath in deep for 3 seconds roughly then out for 6 seconds. Also roughly. Dont try to be specific like me and do it exactly 3 and 6. 

On down the road, life and me under pressure and practicing my breathing because sufferage bleep blop bloop, pandemic. Overwhelming, unadulteraded pain in the brain from an anxiety I'd never expierenced before I saw a vision. It seemed to be the exact same thing that happened to Bill Wilson from AA. A wind blew through me. His words. My words on it are, I was no longer a bound up point in time and space holding on to the memories from the stimulation from the moment. I was free from the tension that came about from the fucking utter bullshit that exists. I let it go. The moment. I stopped holding and figuring. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was like my being afraid got wore out. I remember specifiaclly saying to myself at the height of my pain in a ridgid bodily posture laying in my recline, ""bullshit."" I calle dbullshit on my old beliefs. That old fire and brimstone god. Intstead I chose ""my concept"" of life as my God. My ideas are good to. Changed life.   


About six months later I nearly died from pancreatitis. When I got home from 6 days in the hospital I shared it on facebook. I received a good number of get well soon messages as expected. I did not get what I thought I would. People coming to visit, bringing me food...all that. I nearly fucking died. I know hundreds of people. What does that mean? My perception is fucked up, my beghhvior is fucked up, I need to change.   


I did not think that way at first. At first I thought, ""I fucking hate everyone."" For a while. 

Then 6 months later, I got diagnosed with autism. April 24th 2021.   


6 months later after learning to relax, I rested on my heels for the first time in my life. This began the second chapter of my life. The taking my time portion. The I am the most impotant person in my life to me. You all come second. For ever. I no longer run to the kitchen, the bathroom, through the grocery store, drive fast, or move my limbs fast. I have even taken control of my eyes speed of movement.   


Did you know that your body can control your mind. If you dont control your body your body will be controlled by your environment throught the mind.   


You receive stimulus simply due to being a sensing being. This moves you. If you are not aware of it. Make yourself aware of this and take control of your body, the way you look, smell, move (behavior speed) amplitude of voice ...total bodily control and you can eliminate a great deal of your own suffering. I havew come off my depression meds and greatfully have finally been more aptly medicated with litium. Now I dont have to force myself into slow mo behavior but I do stay aware I think from a bit of fear.   


You can control your thinking!

"Delusional neighborsHi everyone, I live in LA and my neighbors like to talk outside in the hall of the apartment complex. Btw I live in the projects (talking to them nicely is not going to be a solution.)Do not know much about them since they live across the hall. All I know is that there are adults (let us call them the red neighbors) in their thirties or older, do not work and I think they live off food stamps like a lot of people in the projects. There are a total of 5 women possibly not sure. Most of their time they spend talking outside their apartment door, hallway, or staircase. My apartment is less than 20 feet from the staircase so I guess they can hear when I am doing my chores. Lately, I noticed that they have been giving me stares when I see them outside. They used to talk to me before when I moved in years ago ""hi neighbor, how are you?"" when they would see me but shortly after that we stopped. No reason at all and well I do not mind because I have social anxiety so it is hard for me to speak to strangers even if they are my neighbors. So I might come off as shady to people but I am a no-one so why should someone care right? Anyways I also noticed that they have been talking ""quiter"" when I start cooking, or doing laundry, or washing my dishes but I feel like my neighbors think I am nosy and eavesdropping. They have not said anything to me directly but I have heard them say ""stop pretending your cooking"" or sometimes mentioning my apartment number. I am not sure if they were saying this subtle comment directly to me or whatnot but I am always listening to music with my earbuds on so maybe it is in my head.update: I wrote the top part a couple of days ago and left it as a draft bc I did not know what else to write but here is an update on this situation. they asked me when they found me in the lobby. ""I know you are listening to our conversations. do not act stupid. you pretend to cook so you can listen to what we are saying. "" me: ""I have never listened to any of your conversations nor does it interest me. I am often hearing music on my earbuds when I do my chorers. but if you do not like people listening in to your daily convos then I suggest talking outside of the building or in your own apartment"" neighbors: ""I know you are fucking lying. if you continue to do this ill fuck you up!"" I was taken aback by this ""confrontation"" bc I am allowed to do my chores at any time of day. just bc they are out there talking does not mean I should stop and not do it at all until they leave. So I am a bit shaken up since I have anxiety I am getting very nervous. I do know that they were not bluffing when it came down to fighting me. like I mentioned I live in the projects and it is not the nicest place to live nor are people nice here. I can not move out since I have not finished school nor do I have a full-time job. Can anyone help me with how I should go about it??? I am freaking out. i live with other family members and I am scared they might harm them too. we are on the skinny and petite side while they are tall and big so we are at a disadvantage here. I just cannot wrap my head around the reason why they are mad at me. do they feel entitled and why? are they on drugs that it has damaged how they think? Or are other neighbors on my floor talking shit about me to them? I once heard another neighbor (orange neighbor) who I have never talked to but I know his voice since he likes to join them in the hallway. Well, he referred to me as the Spanish female and he kept on repeating my apartment number. To this day I have no idea why. I know this because he was yelling at this point. that another neighbor (pink neighbor) had to come out and calm him down (btw pink, orange, and red neighbors know each other. I think they grew up in the same building since they were children. Also, all the neighbors are thirty or beyond since they have kids) Another instance was that the red neighbors were fighting outside in the hall that pink neighbors stepped in and said to lower the volume bc ""Spanish girl"" is listening. Tf why would I be listening plus I am not the only person living on the floor there are other families and they are being loud enough for everyone to hear. Mind you I was nowhere doing chores but in my bedroom and they were loud enough for me to hear. I just do not get why they are picking on me and I am the Spanish girl since I am the only Spanish on my floor. Why would Pink neighbors say that? Could it be bc they hold a grudge against me? Before COVID pink neighbor's kids used to play in the hall and their kids intentionally would hit my door with a basketball and kick it while laughing. I confronted them and never apologized instead they acted as If I was the villain. Btw all of these neighbors also do not work is that why they are so interested in me since they have nothing else to do??? I start working soon in person again so hopefully, I do not run on them but that is probably a lie since they stay at home all the time. I just do not understand what is it about me that they feel like they could bully me. I have been bullied before so this brings back memories and makes me feel like shit.

"I feel like there is something fundamentally broken with me.*Everyone* told me that after high school I would feel better. I do not think I have ever felt worse in my entire life than I do right now. I have no passions, no aspirations, I do not like doing anything and I have no idea of what to study in university/college. But I *have to* because it is not like I can get myself a decent job if I start crying everytime someone looks at me in public. Between depression and social anxiety my will to live or do anything is pretty much negative. My parents keep yelling at me because finishing high school did not magically cure me. Honestly I hate existing, I hate existing with every single fiber of my being. I feel like shit everyday and people keep telling me to ""appreciate the small things"" as if thinking that a sunset is pretty for 3 seconds will make up for the fact that I have been crying myself to sleep for the past 2 years. fuck you.

However last year and a half i've felt like my symptoms have changed a lot, though i still have all the BPD symptoms, some symptoms like avoidance, social anxiety, isolation, feeling less, came up from nowhere. For matter of fact, i stopped talking to all my ""friends"", stopped working, going out, date, i stopped living. This winter i didn't go out of my appartement, and if it wasn't for my mother, i would probably have died of hunger. Going out doesn't scare me, people outside does. I feel like they all stare at me and they know how shitty i am, i feel like i'm not like them and whatever i do i'm not enough. Even open the shutters is a damn burden. Sometimes i think i might be paranoid, but i don't think people wan't me any harm nor i feel persecuted, i'm just ashamed of myself...

"Sorry in advance for lengthy post. To start, my husband (41) &amp; I (40) have been together for about 25 years. I have gone through dark stages in my life. Suicidal thoughts + failed attempts. I used work as a coping method but I did not get anywhere with my work. still a manager while an account assistant I worked with 10+ years ago is now a Director. Due to unexpected post partum complication, I was hospitalized after giving birth. Hormone roller coaster. Zero visitors b/c of Covid. Finally was on antidepressant. I stopped them after hospital discharge. Fast forward to now, I start to feel that our marriage and feelings for each other has changed. I understand dynamics change with a baby but why do I always feel hes cheating? Sex life is nonexistent since pregnancy. We were both very excited and blessed with this child as conceiving was difficult. the happiest moment in our lives became the saddest at the same time. Enduring the pain of not being able to see my newborn meanwhile , He took care of our baby himself. Its as if we fought our own battles. It was not easy for both of us &amp; I thought it would only make us stronger. Yet why do I feel the opposite?I have had similar episodes before where I feel our marriage is failing &amp; all I wanted was to leave this world. I have started having same sad feelings. Sensitivity level is high. quickly boils down to a failed relationship. he has not been sleeping well the past few days. The other day he suddenly woke up and went for his morning walk with the dog. Typically, wed go together. I called him as I could not see him at the park. Finally he came back and I asked him where he was &amp; that I called him five times. He pulled out his phone &amp; said he had it on silent somehow. I do not know why my first instinct was that he met up with someone. Maybe because his walk was much longer than usual? I know hes been bothered by work lately but my first thought his insomnia was possibly because this other woman is pregnant or something(?)Yesterday was tough. I was sick to my stomach with the feeling hes definitely seeing someone. I was quite certain hell leave us. That He has already forgotten about our baby, our love, our excitement when we first learned of the news. Thoughts came rushing in. Sadness swelled up my body. I had thoughts of leaving, I craved alcohol and had a few sips. The feeling of leaving this world was strong. The emptiness. The feeling that you have lost everything. The pain of feeling sorry for bringing my child here. The disgusted feeling of being weak and feeling like a coward. I am not even qualified to be a mom and my baby will be better off without me. Our baby turned one and still young so maybe husband will Be able to find a better mom. And while holding my baby to sleep, I asked if I can bear not being able to see the beautiful smile, hear the laughter and chuckles. And as the thoughts came about, they flooded my eyes. I feel I am doing more harm than good to my baby. Will my baby forgive me? knowing its probably better developmentally , does it matter if I am forgiven?Perhaps it would have been better for everyone if I had just died with the complication last year.

"Here we go again: EMDR Take 2 I have PTSD as the result of an extensive history of sexual abuse. My therapist guided me through 9 months of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) in 2016. It was BRUTAL, but my symptoms were nearly nonexistent after we finished it up. I recently have had some symptoms pop back up, and after an assessment it appears that I’m in need of a “tune up” as my therapist calls it. So here we go again... I’m starting it again today. I hope that it’ll be a little less sucky since I’ve put some hard work into it previously and that it’ll be short-lived compared to 9 months of nonstop weekly EMDR sessions. I’m still EXTREMELY anxious as I get closer and closer to my appointment today because I know that things will get worse before they get better.

Has anyone been through EMDR before? Do you have any coping skills that help you, especially in between sessions when your brain is processing everything? 

PS: For the record, I’m not trying to scare anyone who is facing the possibility of going through this process. Doing EMDR has changed my life for the better. I’ve had PTSD as long as I can remember, and the relief that it’s brought me has been amazing. Just stick it out until it gets better.

I hate being here.

"Hi all, in my short 19 years on this earth I have been through many trials and triumphs but my life seems to be getting progressively worse and I have not had the best life I ever and already feel like I have lived a lifetime worth of experiences due to the trauma I have experienced in my life like: sexual, emotional, physical abuse, stabbed someone when I was 17 and attacked them with mallet due to bullying, being involved with a police chase, surviving car accident, being a addict and addicted to alcohol at age 17 until last (year age 19),being deaf in left ear from birth, survived surgery, survived many illness and infection as a young child, and being revived at birth due to oxygen loss, severe bullying, I have had around 50-60 suicidal episodes last year and have had many more prior. I managed to obtain my NCEA Lvl 1,2,3 even though I was kicked out of school due to being sevely bullied and having everyone hate me, I have had many fun sexual experiences, done some pretty crazy and one of a kind stuff, seen and done things alot of people could ever do etc. I always made sure to live every day as if it was my last and live fearless so I have lived my life on the edge and to the fullest although I was lonely and sad alot of it due to anxiety and past trauma. But things were starting to look up around last year I acquired a good job and a wonderful partner S.C. ironically I had my car accident 15mins after I dropped her off at a friend's place as she stayed at mine and we had only met in person the night before. But our relationship prospered and that crash made me become clean from alcohol and drugs because of the thought of her and prospect of career and family I have always wanted to raise children and live on a farm in the countryside etc. But... My life has changed for the worst now=Initially my illness started about 1am on Jan 18th 2021 after I awoke from a vivid nightmare drenched in sweat then I had an auditory hallucination and diahorrea and vertigo and derealization/confusion and brainfog and was shivering with chills but after I went back to sleep it went away within 1-day and in between time I went on holiday and suffered vertigo and ear pain on the car ride down and the initial sickness did not appear until Feb 9th I got the bad flu w/sore throat, vertigo, ear pain, coughing, running nose, chills, diahorrea etc. And on Feb 13th I then suffered derealization, severe brainfog, crying and sadness and anxiety, REM sleep issues like: falling sensation that jolts awake, flashing behind eyelids, hypnogogic hallucination, constant vivid nightmares every night, head pressure, diahorrea, excessive urination and short-term memory loss and a bunch of other stuff then around early March came a psychotic ocd presentation where I had this delusion I was developing shitzophrenia and had an intense fear of it and constantly Googled it then that sort of stopped and the derealization died down a bit and I was left with andeonia complete loss of emotions and then severe depression and mood swings the came these mini-stroke/seizures and severe brainfog that happened around start of last month and every time I had them I was getting memory-loss after long term and short-term almost dementia like memory loss then I developed an internal vibration. So currently of now my symptoms are: a slight brainfog, internal vibration, dementia memory-loss, vivid nightmares: still having hypnogogic hallucination upon waking, minor head pressure, crying and sadness/severe depression, and complete loss of emotional enjoyment in life, loss of track of time and what is going on around me, inability to retain information, loss of imagination, hair thinning, easily bruising, loss of libido, abdomen pain. So as of now I am 5.5 months into this illness and shts only getting worse I have had many blood tests, tried different diets, meds help with mood but none of the other symptoms, tried therapy, had 2 CT scans of head w/o Contrast tried heaps nothing works. I personally think it is maybe autoimmune encephalitis due to a virus, covid maybe? Not sure. So yeah I am pre much F'ed atm. Me and my girlfriend do long distance and she has stuck by me all through this, she flys up to where I live today as her family lives here and she comes up every school holidays I love her so much and she says she loves and supports me and will do till death and we are keeping each other alive as she struggles with her own issues too but I just feel useless and dead. An example is my nana she is in a dementia home and you look into her eyes and the life is just gone... No soul, just a lost mind trapped within a body that imprisons her that is how I feel atm and I do not want this to go on forever as I cannot feel life and emotions and feel severaly disconnected from everything and have impaired cognitive function as well as experiencing symptoms on the daily. I have always had a different insight on life I feel and have always thought and felt different from others idk why but I just have I feel special in this world and sometimes I wonder if it is just me alive and everyone else is figure of imagination idek haha. My plan is too spend my last 2-weeks with her and then if I feel no better or see no reason to continue then I will end it. Sorry for all the words and wall of text you prolly do not need my life story but I want to make sure my story is read by atleast someone before I go.As many of you know its a dog eat dog world and weakness is not tolerated and only the strongest survive unfortunately I am no longer strong and just a she will of a man really so yeah I was crying afraid of death and asking why this has happened to me for ages every night alone but I now realise maybe the good go first so we do not experience as much suffering as the bad who live on and generally die alone. The world is a strange place atm and is just full of pain, narcassism, suffering, corruption.

I had success but most of the money went to investors (founded a company that sold for $27M). Have been working on another startup for 8 years and making minimal income and living off savings. Doing it all myself as I do not trust people anymore. Been through a divorce caused by this and was in a marriage that meant I could not properly run my new startup for most of that time. Ex took half my assets and I am sure was putting a lot extra away for years.It is ridiculously hard. I have a product as good as anything in the market and comparable to other products raising 10's of millions of dollars. But I cannot get it out there, nothing I do works enough. I now have a product that probably requires a team of developers and I am maintaining it all myself and trying to grow the business.I am just so tired, burnt out and depressed I cannot do the things I need to do to make this work anymore and I feel I am going to lose everything.The only thing keeping me going is the thought that I have the product and the hope that one day I will get noticed or will be able to get my marketing sorted and get in front of the right customers.I feel I am going backwards and everyone I know seems to be going forward on easy mode. Home are going up in value (we sold our beautiful big house in the divorce and now renting), well paying jobs with minimal effort (IT).I just spent my entire weekend working and doubt it will make a dent while other people are enjoying their lives.I will never find a partner again as I am financially ruining myself.I just want to end it all but my 10 year old daughter still needs me. It would devastate her if I was gone. For the last few years I have just been thinking try to last as long as you can until she does not need you as much (maybe 16). I am not living for any future now, I do not look forward to anything.

"Back story how I got to where I am. I am 20F and I moved in with my boyfriend a few months ago. Everything was going great until I got depressed again. I could take care of myself properly, could not get myself motivated to do anything, slept in later than I should. And my bf tried to help me in a way I told him time and time again that it would not work. For some reason everytime someone in my life pushes me to do things that I am scared of or have a hard time doing, I just shut down completely. I agree I was pretty terrible to live with. Some days I helped out so much around the house and other days I could not get myself to do anything at all. I also did not have a job because he would not jump start my car because he was so afraid of me crashing my car on purpose (I would not do that). Flash forward to three weeks ago: everything got worse, we started fighting constantly. He told me I should have tried harder and he was right. He said it was killing him to see me like this. He said if I did not get myself fixed or start doing more for myself that hell kick me out. So I slowly started to do more and take care of myself. However, we still fought constantly. I still could not get him to realize how I felt the way I do and could not get him to start my car. So with that being said I still could not get a job and he hated that. Flash forwarded again, last night he packed up all of my things and kicked me out. The entire time telling me he felt so bad for doing this but it all my fault. Then he got moody and told me that until I get better that we can only be friends. So I was crying hysterically and could not drive myself back to my parents so, he had to take me home. I had a bad panic attack to the point I could not breathe and my whole body was all locked up joint wise. Took him a bit to realized that I was not just trying to get him to let me stay and I needed help with it. He told me if I start making progress with myself that we can start seeing eachother again but I feel lost. My parents are so mad at me because I failed my relationship. They because very strict with me and are pushing me the exact way I told them it would not help. there is more but this is the just of what happened. I just need someone to listen and encourage me to do better.",Depression,"{""category"": ""Stress""}",2025-04-21 04:05:42.826483,e5-large-v2

I just can’t do it anymore. I live under constant pressure due to work, so many sleepless nights, thoughts racing in my head, stupid scenarios I build, poor nutrition and so many times of crying uncontrollably.
I don’t want to blame external factors but there has been constant miscommunication which also led to where we’re at.

Overheard nephew telling people all I do is sleep and that he does not like that I lived with him. Dad stopped having genuine conversations with me after talking to the cops.

"Here’s my story (LONG) Hey, I’ve been suffering from health anxiety for years now (4-6yrs). I’m 18 now. It all started with me having a tight throat feeling which I have because of GERD (I didn’t know at that time), and I searched it up on google and all my symptoms matched thyroid cancer, etc. I got panic attacks, laying in bed for hours searching on google at age 13.  It became so bad that I never went outside. I used to either tell my friends I’m sick, or just talk to them over the phone to something. 2014 is when I developed my first real disease, called Visual Snow, symptoms are where you are tiny dots over your vision, like pixels. Luckily I’ve managed to ignore that and accepted it as a part of me. 

At age 16 I dropped out of high school because I was unable to wake up in the morning and get ready. Since I dropped out of high school I developed BDD (Body Dysmorphia). It became so bad that I never went out in daylight. I checked the mirrors every 30 minutes, hated my face, etc.  Now I’m 18 and have noticed 4 months ago that my tongue twitches in the mirror (fasciculations). I even read ALS patients never feel their twitches in the tongue. Just like me. At this point, I take it as it is.

could not really find the perfect title its more about the process of finding someone which I would consider dating and I was wondering if someone here felt the same or experienced the same and might give me some advice.So I had this happen a few times in the last year where I get to know someone and it feels like I am completely falling in love with the other person even tho I barely know them just because it feels nice being around them. But it really hit me a week ago. I met this girl at a party and we had a one night stand sorta. We could not sleep alot so we just layed next to each other talked and kissed for like 6 hours till 11am.I have not felt better in the last year. I just felt safe being with her. When I woke up that night I did not think about how I wanted to sleep again or how I would just like to kill myself my mind was at rest atleast for a while.do not get me wrong I liked that girl but I barely know her and she is probably not even really my type but I still feel like I would do anything for her or for being with her again and more often. Its not rational but this happens so often although this time the feeling is so much stronger. I feel like I am being so heavily influence by the fact that I am not feeling good at all. This makes things like that so much stronger and I cannot think rational. I cannot distinguish between the feeling of me actually being into someone or just being into the feeling I get when I am around them. And you could probaly change that girl with any other random one and Id feel the same for just that person. Just because I did not think about blowing my brains out while next to her I feel like she is the one.Anyways thanks for reading. Similar storys/thoughts and advice very much appreciated.

"Thanks for being the community I never dreamt to have  

so yesterday I had a therapy session, and the therapist asked why i think  i have no friends.

i answered i have interests that few share, where i live as i live in a small city, so it is hard to have friends or form relations based on interests. also, i have no interest in sports and that is the common interest where i live 

i told him i am part of many online communities, but i just lurk as i feel that i don't belong enough to participate in  these communities even if they are based on my interests

at that moment i remembered reddit and this community, and i felt that i already have a community where i can freely be who i am without  fear

When I joined reddit it was for something tech related, then i said why not searching for avoidant and i was expecting nothing but to my surprise i found this sub, and it was unbelievable as it is hard to find anything related to avoidant

i was new to reddit and navigating it, but i was happy as i found people like me.

as i kept browsing, i started to get related more and more to your posts. I felt a connection to you,  and i realized i am not alone anymore.

Knowing i am not alone anymore, is one of the greatest things anyone can ask for, it meant i have People who can understand me and my struggle and what i am going through.

People who can understand me and i can understand them.

People with who i can share whatever i want, knowing they will understand me and won't judge me 

in this community,i don't hesitate or feel shy to share anything with you

from sharing memes to asking questions and seeking help and advice

here, I share my problems and secrets that no one knows, including my family.

I finally found a home here and family 

this community really seems like an oasis in the desert 

I have more to say about this community but i want to keep this post short as possible.

I thought that I would feel better with that whole college thing behind me but nos it just feels worse because I feel like I wasted 4 years and thousands in student loans for nothing. I do not feel motivated by anything anymore, and nothing really improved. I lost all my passion and all I do is letting myself rot in my bed all day. My family mostly thinks about how much they wasted by helping me paying off my college fees instead caring for my personal career opportunities and I just feel like everyone is letting me down since I am one of the few who failed. I have no more will to do anything nor to see anyone, and I even keep avoiding my roomate so I do not have any kind of human interaction because I am just a big ball of angst and do not want to project it on anyone (also because people are just a pain in the ass tbh).Now the ""best summer of my life"" is beginning by me feeling guilt and angst because of college and all my plans getting aborted because of sudden financial issues and me leaving the only small trip that made me feel a bit less stressed out because of health issues (and more fees yay).I do not really know how to feel motivated to do anything again and I just cannot get over that angst and disappointment feeling.

"Paranoia and Anxiety about that Brain Eating Amoeba Hi everyone. I'm pretty new to this sub, but I really need to vent.

 I was diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder two years ago and I generally have a pretty good hold of it. Yesterday, I was showering and a drop or two or water got into one nostril in my nose. I could feel it chilling in my nose hair and I immediately used my towel to wipe it out and then I blew my nose when I got out of the shower. However, I live in Florida, and I'm really paranoid that the brain eating amoeba is lurking in the water. This was water from the shower head in my dorm and it has been colder lately, but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I'm terrified; I'm even tearing up with fear writing this. My birthday is next week and I want to be okay for that and for everything. My mom said I'm worrying needlessly and she's probably right but I can't shake the anxiety.

"Paxil withdrawal induced hypomania/rapid cycle I f**ed up my life in just 2 weeks.

My brief history:

* fall 2014 was prescribed Paxil 20mg/day for mild depression, anxiety and hypochondria. 
* Tapered from 20mg to 10mg in 6 month.
* I was on 10mg since June 2015 till August 2017. So: 2 years, 10mg daily. I always took medicine before go sleep.
* I tapered from 10mg/day to 2.5mg/day in 5-7 months (August 2017 ~ March 2018)
* I stopped to take medication 2 weeks ago (20 of March).

Until this point I was TOTALLY FINE. 

Now detailed description of last 2 weeks:

* First 5 days were totally fine
* On day 6 (30 MArch) first withdrawals symptoms kicked in: shivering, cold, severe insomnia
* On day 12 (1 April) withdrawals was unbearable, experience first manic/depressive episode. Decided to reinstate on 5mg(and later 10mg)/day. I took my first half pill midday.
* Day 13 (2 April): 5mg morning, 5mg evening
* Day 14 (3 April): 5mg morning, 0mg evening
* Day 15 (4 April): 5mg morning, 5mg evening
* Day 16 (today, 5 April): 5 mg morning

The symptoms I have now are rather painful and hardly bearable. Most prominent are: RAPID cycling from depressive episodes(+moredate agitation and anxiety) to hypomanic episodes and severe insomnia. Cycles changing every few hours and quite intensive! I never had this before, never!! Now I'm totally off, confused, suicidal, haven't slept cople nights. I'm in  hypomanic episode right now so I can write this post. I took sick leave at my work, but if this will continue I will lose my job completely. I beg you for advice on how I can stabilize now, based on what I've already done. I'm not even looking to weaning off meds now, as there are a lot of life circumstances now that I responsible for. I just want to stabilize and reduce pain.
What I can do at this point? It's do hard to believe I broke my brain beyond repair so rapidly, just in 2 weeks. I was normal, happy and fully of life. Now I'm anxious, agitated and depress vegetable, lying on the coach wanting to die/suicide.
Any advice highly appreciated.

P.S. yes, I visited my GP,  he put me on a waiting list to mental illness clinic (waiting time ~4 weeks) and advised to continue Paroxetine 10mg/day for 2 weeks and then increase to 20mg/day if needed.

He also told me that my right pupil was smaller then the left one so he called some neurologist and he did some tests but there was nothing wrong with them.

"Vitamin D and B-12 Deficiency Sorry about lack of clarity, I’m not exactly sure how to phrase this because I’m confused myself, and I am on mobile.

I sought out treatment after I was having some pretty concerning suicidal thoughts the past year.

I reached out the a therapist at my University, and immediately was referred to a psychiatrist under the guise of maybe benefitting from mood stabilizers.

Before my psychiatry appointment, I researched into mood stabilizers and saw they were used in treating bipolar. Read up on bipolar and really identified/ understood why she would recommend me to the psychiatrist assuming she thought I could have bipolar. 

Met with the psychiatrist, and not to my surprise she said she was sure I was bipolar. However she wanted me to get bloodwork before starting me on lithium to see my levels in various things. She said she was going to diagnose me official with unspecified mood disorder until she saw my results regarding my thyroid. 

I was pretty bummed hearing this news, she essentially told me I had bipolar disorder but lacked whether it was I or II, so I still felt lost but like I was on the right track.

Well, my blood work came back and everything was normal except I had extremely low vitamin D and B-12. My psychiatrist called me and gave me dosage for otc vitamins. I read into the situation wrong and assumed she was just reducing my issues down to deficiencies.

I know these two deficiencies do not explain mania. Maybe vitamin D explains psychosis, but I don’t experience this. I felt like everyone was so sure I was bipolar and led me on to thinking I had a solution, and I think this issue runs deeper than just supplements.

I know many mental illnesses have links to vitamin deficiencies, and I guess my confusion comes from whether or not anyone else experienced this along with being bipolar. I have an appointment on Thursday, first one since bloodwork, and was wondering if I should mention the bipolar diagnosis if she doesn’t.

TLDR; is my doctor reducing her diagnosis to needing vitamin d and b-12? Can this and bipolar coincide? ",Bipolar,"{""category"": ""Bipolar""}",2025-04-21 04:11:36.741969,e5-large-v2

"How being outside reduces stress I will explain why being outside is good for your health. Nowadays we are often indoors almost all day because of school and work. There’s not always something wrong with that, but you’ll probably feel a lot better if you go outside every now and then.

**IT MAKES THE MIND CLEARER**

Inside a house, study or workplace there are often many things that make you think about your work or study. There is nothing wrong with this, but it can ensure that you are constantly busy with your work or study. This may keep you thinking and living in your head instead of in the moment. In addition, there are all kinds of other distractions indoors that keep your mind from calming down. So go outside and enjoy the tranquility.

**LESS STRESS**

This tranquility automatically reduces stress. You are not busy with school, your work, or other things. As a result, you go out of your head and into the moment. This will also reduce your stress and reduce the risk of stress symptoms and complaints. In addition, physical exercise is also a great way to reduce stress. When you are physically active you can reduce stress. You probably also feel that when you exercise. And after you exercise you notice that your stress is reduced compared to before you started exercising.

"I have been struggling with depression since my mid/late teens. I am in college now; and I thought Id be better once I moved away from my family( toxic). However I think I might have actually gotten worse. All the stress for deadlines, rent, if I have enough money for food, if I can afford medicine for my cold, it just keeps building up. I am not sure if I want to handle the stress of being an adult. I cannot help but imagine running away and disappearing from the world. Devolving into my self and then into the water and ceasing to exist. It sounds so much easier than life. I took on a computer science degree durring the pandemic. I wanted to learn a new profitable skill so I could eventually support myself with a secure and I demand job. However online college, its not how my brain learns. From distanced learning; I cannot process and if the information, and if I took the time to relearn every lesson from a tutor ( I learn best being taught in person) then I would not have the time to earn money and study, or the means to eat a proper meal. And if I finished my freshman year of college not retaining any information; I feel like I am screwed for the next year. If I have spent so much money and time just to show no improvement; why am I even here. I want to drop out if college. But then Id have to work a minimum wage or lower job and try to support myself and still deal with the stress of being an adult. When ever my depression gets very bad I start seeing things out of the corner of my eye. Normally its ropes and Nuces hanging from trees or light posts . If it continues then I start to see peoples dead body hanging from them. Just out of the corner of my eye, then Ill turn to look. And there is nothing there.I do not think I even check if its real anymore. Its just become the shadow of people in the corner of my eye , swinging slightly with the wind.

I financially cannot do it anymore and mentally cannot do it anymore because of harassment and bullying from people in the community. I do not see it getting any better financially and I have been in therapy for as long as I can remember to get help with my social anxiety and other mental issues that make it fucking impossible for me to deal with people like that.

"I am promising this because I have experienced it.On Monday, I attempted suicide, and now I was being serious. Before this attempt, I had only self harmed and overdosed in small amounts. On Monday I drank an entire bottle of sleeping pills. I was seriously going to die.While I was still conscious, I started feeling regret. For the first time in 2 years, I realized that my problems did have a solution and a date. They were eventually going to end, but committing suicide was the only mistake I was not able to retract from.I felt regret. I felt treater for all the things I did not do. I felt regret for leaving my loved ones behind. I did not have enough strength to call 911, so I just blacked out praying because I still wanted to live. Miracles happen, and me being able to write this is one of them.I did not die. I cannot explain how. I drank 100 pills, did not go to the hospital, and somehow managed to survive.Today, one of my friends called me. She even invited me to a trip.I thought I was alone. I thought no one cared about me. It turned out to be false. People care. I only had to wait 2 days more.If I had died on Monday, I would have died believing a lie. I would have died thinking that my life was doomed.

"Lumps on neck and head now. Okay so first of all thank you for reading this, I am struggling with bad anxiety right now. 

I have had two lumps on the side of my neck for 2 years now and have been told in the past by a doctor that they were nothing. I was put on antibiotics (which didn't seem to help) and sent away. I recently had them checked out again and the doctor ordered an ultrasound (which I have yet to go to) to make sure they weren't cancer. I have zero symptoms otherwise.

 Fast forward to now I have a larger lump on the back left side of my scalp. I'm trying to tell myself it's just a cyst but the anxious pattern seeking side of me is having a hard time time letting it go.  It's larger than the other two and is  hard and hurts a little when I apply pressure. 

There are a few causes I can think of 

1. It's just a cyst, and completely unrelated to my other two swollen lymph nodes. My fathet has a history of cysts, which may account for mine.

2. I'm pretty sure I remember hitting my head on something about a week ago, so it could just be a bruise of sorts. (memory isn't clear)

3. Cancer. I'm gonna die, hit the panic button, ect...

4. I recently have been having allergies or a cold which could be due to an infection which could be making my lymph nodes react. 


This is the way my anxious mind sees it: I must have cancer because there is now a third lump to add on the other two I've had for years. I've left it untreated for so long that I'm scared to even go to a doctor. Now it must be spreading to my brain which would probably make it inoperable. I will get brain cancer and die at 19 due to my lack of action.

I'm honestly having trouble deciphering hypochondria from reality.

I'm hoping someone besides myself could make a determination as to whether or not I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thank you.

"Hi all, first time here hope you guys are doing well. To start, I can tell you that being a 5 foot tall male living here in America is worse than death. Everyone treats me like absolute shit, from strangers, friends, family, and of course women. it is already challenging making friends, dating life is on a whole other level of difficulty. I have had countless instances from strangers to even family giving me dirty looks, treating me unfairly solely for my height. I have followed the advice of what short males should do, such as working on yourself by improving looks, earning money, confidence, personality, etc. I have done all that, I am an attractive guy, I have money, and I am muscular for my size. I workout and I am 160lbs at 18% bodyweight, which is huge for my size. Despite all these positives that everyone says you should focus on, it has not changed a thing as far as dating life. There has been two instances in which I have been told the exact quote ""I would date you if you were taller"" by my crushes, once in high school and the other recently in college, and these events destroyed me. I do not get any attention from women even though I have all these attributes. I cannot really blame them because they can probably find someone else who has exactly all the same qualities as me, only that they are taller so why the fuck would they go for me? I am nothing special. I am currently 20, studying a passion that I love at a good university, and I have a family that cares for me. Those are the only reasons I have not offed myself yet. My parents have used so much of their time and money putting into my education and life, and I know if I kill myself my entire family's life will be ruined forever. And my depression/suicidal thoughts are completely hidden from them because I am too embarrassed to tell them or anyone else for the matter. it is just not an option, I am sorry. Reflecting on my current life, I literally have no friends. Barely had any success dating wise. These past years have made me turn into a person that I never thought I would become. I began hating everyone I see, especially if they were taller because I keep questioning why life fucked me over for my height while everyone else gets to enjoy theirs normally. And I am sorry if you think this is not a reason for suicide, but to me it is been the biggest problem of my life that I just cannot handle any longer. I really do not know how much longer I can tolerate this. I fear that I will never get to live a normal life as everyone else from enjoying time with friends to being loved romantically with a partner, so why would I waste anytime and just end it all now?

"Battling with intrusive thoughts Tw: (thoughts of) self harm, drug abuse, suicidal thoughts 
(m/22, if you care)


First things first, I really need to vent right now and dont know if anyone is even gonna read that but I just need to get this out of my head.
And sorry, if my english isn't good...

So, I've been battling depression for over a decade, I've mostly gotten better after years of therapy and carefully choosing the people around me so I've been pretty stable for a few years with less and less backlashes.

Today marks the first day after about 3 years where I'm getting extremely intense thoughts about self harming, drug abuse and even suicidal thoughts.

I've already been in a pretty bad mood today, overthinking a lot and shit like that and I had to go to social event I didn't really wanna take part in but usually it turns out better than expected. It wasn't like that today. I've felt even worse and useless (despite my friends trying to cheer me up) and realized that I'm not good at anything. I tried to drink those thoughts away with some cocktails (which usually works wonders for me in social events) but that just made it worse.
Since I got home I've just been sitting on my bed and staring at the wall, my thoughts going through a downward spiral. I drank some more and feel better and worse at the same time. I've even got to the point that I noticed another issue I haven't even realized before but makes so much sense comparing it to the events in my life. Then I thought of numbing my pain with a method I used years ago, forced myself not to because the scars have almost faded out. Then I thought about what drugs I could use to distract my mind, even started to research before I stopped myself and decided to rant here.
I'm very aware of my thoughts which makes me instantly feel regretful and even more like a shitty person.

I just want to cry and try to vent through that but that's something I still can't do. Love society for teaching boys that they aren't allowed to cry.

Anyways, I hope I can force myself to focus on something else now that I've written this shit down. My mind does feel a bit clearer now without taking some extreme steps.

Also to everyone reading this: I hope you have a great day tomorrow. And maybe we can all fight our inner demons some day and live a better life. Just trying to survive one day at a time.",Depression,"{""category"": ""Suicidal""}",2025-04-21 04:20:57.465384,e5-large-v2

Perhaps I just want someone to notice. Someone to acknowledge the fact I am suffering. I feel so unseen. All of my suicide attempts I failed on purpose because I desperately wanted someone to see that I really was doing badly and just wanted to be loved and cared for.

"Terrified of brain amoeba / fowleri Hi everyone. I'm down in South Australia, and I've found myself going a little insane over something very silly for the last day....

I will start by saying that our water has a decent amount of chlorine as far as I can tell, it's the only thing you can taste in the water, and if you fill a bathtub it's even ever so slightly green. There's never been an order to boil water or anything of the sort either here.

So moving onto story time. I often get itchy eyes before bed, so I keep a glass of water in the bathroom, that way I can rinse my eyes out quickly to calm things down, the glass of water had probably been out for a few hours, anywhere from 6- 12. Last night I did it, and as the water ran down my face a little bit got in my nose, maybe a drop or 2 tops. I started freaking a minute later as I remembered all I'd read about fowleri.... I blew my nose a bunch, and I rolled up some toilet paper, and stuck it up my nostril as well in an attempt to deal with any water that had made its way up there. I spent a terrified hour in bed reading things on my phone, and eventually calmed down enough to sleep.

Now all day today I haven't had a fever or anything of the sort, but I have been getting sinus headaches. (Quite possibly from blowing my nose so much) And I got rather paranoid in the shower too, anytime water got near my nose, or even the tiniest bit might have entered I freaked out a bit. My right nostril which is the one the water entered is also worse than the left, but the discomfort might just be from me freaking out and blowing it a ton... I have bad sinuses at the best of times, so it could just be dust or allergies too.

I know I'm probably being silly, but some confirmation would be lovely, especially since the glass of water, while cold was sitting out a long time... A day of sinus headaches just doesn't exactly fill me with confidence, even if it probably was cause I wouldn't leave things alone. One last thing to note is that 2 family members of mine recently had colds, so that might be why I'm feeling crappy sinus wise too, the right side being worse than the left still has me all freaked out though.",Anxiety,"{""category"": ""Anxiety""}",2025-04-21 04:22:01.949413,e5-large-v2

Your Microsoft office subscription has expired, because everything needs to be a continuing revenue stream to milk you dry.Want to watch Netflix? YouTube without ads that remind you about what you cannot afford and send you into a spiral? New shoes because you have one pair and it is been falling apart for the past year? Reup to your laser hair removal so you can look at yourself in the mirror crying. A new pair of underwear because you are somehow down to just three? Everything is too fucking expensive.

"It's getting worse 19F, I've been struggling with depression for 2 years now, the main things that have been making everything worse are my family issues. My parents are going to court soon for alleged threat to kill charges and i was forced to testify against my mother. The court date is 6 days from now and I'm losing my mind, I never ever want to hurt people especially my family, I always tiptoe around them and put them before myself, but no one ever does the same for me, no one even realised the state I'm in. They only care about themselves and yet I always get blamed for their problems, worries, misfortunes, etc., I've only ever tried, I try so hard to make everyone feel safe and happy. I ran away from home, start abusing substances, lost so many people, have internal self loathing, deal with traumatising memories of getting constantly molested by my older brother, started self harming and not eating. life is a fucking cycle of everlasting pain.",Depression,"{""category"": ""Suicidal""}",2025-04-21 04:30:35.565615,e5-large-v2

"How do you even begin to explain your depression? I am hurting and I feel super alone. I have people around me and I am sure they will listen, but to what extent? I have ended up here because I feel like I am imploding and just want someone to hear me and know what I feel. I am a wife and a mother of one. My marriage is happy and my son is amazing, but I cannot get away from my depression and anxiety. I have had a bounty of traumatic experiences growing up, but who has not? I truly try to live for each day and leave the past where it belongs. I am extremely self-aware. I understand my mental illness. I am a very analytical person. I think that because of this, it makes my mental health worse. I want to fix myself, but I do not know how. I have extreme fears of being alone. I am terrified my husband will eventually decide to leave me because I am such a disaster (though he has shown no intention of this at all). Who wants to be married to a crazy person, right? I have never been in a relationship that was not emotionally abusive until I married my husband. Both of my parents were drug addicts and I was raised by my grandparents (who are incredible by the way). My biological mother (who was physically and emotionally abusive) is still a piece of work (putting it nicely). It took years, but my dad recovered and I do love him very much even though he still has some issues I am still uncomfortable with. In spite of that I have become a successful person. I swore Id never ever let my children see a moment of what I did as a child, and I have not, but I am still here feeling like a failure. I feel worthless. My insecurity is disgusting and my fears are eating me alive. I guess it does not help that I have barely any friends and now that I am working from home I am basically left to my own torment, every day. I used to have loads of friends when I lived in another city, but once I became pregnant I decided I needed to be closer to family. I did not move back home, just near. So I moved to a small town where I know no one. After starting my job once I moved. I have begun to have friends again, but none of them I feel close enough to be able to really open up. Honestly they are probably very open to listening, but I am still here terrified of judgment and causing what little friends I do have to go running for the hills. Because who wants to be friends with someone so mentally unstable?I am tired of crying and I want my brain to stop. I just want to fix my mental state. I can fix everything else. I can give the best advice and I have picked so many people up from very low points in their lives, but I cannot fix me. I am so sorry this is so long.

"Pulsatile tinnitus So over the last week or so I've noticed that for about 10-15 seconds each day, I've heard a pulsing sound in my ear that sounds like a fan whirring. At first I thought it was an external sound, but then I pinned it down to coming from inside my head when I was in the bathroom one time. I googled it and it came up with pulsatile tinnitus, and it said the cause could be tumours, aneurysms, high blood pressure, hearing loss etc. 

I hear it in my right ear, and as I said it's normally for around 10 seconds a day at random times. I've been unable to trigger it or find a way to induce it; there seems to be no pattern to it. Which is odd because people who mention this talk of it being constant.  

I exercise regularly and do cardio, and I'm cutting down on my caffeine consumption to see if that helps. I've heard this can be a symptom of anxiety or can just be heightened awareness of my own body, which makes sense but don't exactly know what that means. You'd think I'd have noticed this before.

"My Goodbye NoteI am tired, I do not even know where to start, but I am tired. Ever since I was little, my dream has been studying and becoming a professional in a career I can be proud of. I was the type to take college classes in high school so I could expedite the process. When I got the opportunity to move the USA at the age of 15, of course I said yes. Yes, dad! Of course I want to go. The land of opportunity, the land of the free. It has been more than 10 years, and I have been anything but free. I am 26 years old, and I have not started my career. I am an illegal immigrant. I cannot graduate, drive or work (unless I do so illegally, which has never been my desire; breaking the rules has always been my worst nightmare). Doing the wrong thing completely paralyzes me. I do not suppose dad knew what he was doing when he moved us to this country. And yes, I could have left, but it does not work like that in our family, where the man of the house is the ruler and tyrant. Leaving meant having nowhere to go with no roof over my head or food in my stomach. I have always struggled to make friends, I guess they all have sensed the brokenness that is in me and ran the other way. As the months go by, my interest in people diminishes. I want to be left alone. do not talk to me, do not look at me, do not breathe on me (please ignore all this and love me anyways). Just give up on me and leave (please fight for me). I understand I am hard to love, which makes this decision a little easier. Dad, even though you were tough on me, I know you were just as broken as me. I do not want to follow in your footsteps. I tried. I really tried. But I am you. Mom, I love you so much and I am sorry. You do not deserve to lose your only daughter, but I cannot do this anymore. Hubby. You have tried your best to be patient and be there for me. But my presence is a burden that you do not deserve to handle. I hope you find love again.

Personality is defined as the collection of behavior, attitude, and ways of expressing emotions that makes a person unique.

Like not just what I want to do, and how I want to live (that is if I do not off myself first lol) but like in a bigger sense like why are we humans here? What is the point of us existing. Basically I have become very existential. So as I think of life as a whole everything really seems empty and pointless. Like even if I lived my idea of a perfect life I think Id still feel empty inside because what is the point of anything really?I feel like this is not something you can even tell someone in real life because they will think you are suicidal. Which I am I know but when I become existential and think of mankind as a whole and all that I am not suicidal. Like its a different feeling then when I want to die because my life sucks and when I am existential I just do not want to exist on this plane of existence because like what is the point. Do you get what I am saying!?Anyway I feel like this is not something humans are supposed to think about. Like if you say you do not want to exist because what is the point people will tell you your suicidal and that is wrong to want to die. But why should not I want to not kill myself? Why if I see how meaningless and small life is and do not want to be involved in it its wrong and I am supposed to seek help.

"I can't cope with my job I work from home as a software developer, most aspects of the job are too triggering, and I can’t handle it.

Every morning starts with a daily update meeting. Since I usually had done only 0-30 minutes of work the previous day, I have no update to give, I panic and have to lie, and the lie is transparent. Afterwards I have to cool down from the shame, guilt, and stress. It’s already hard to recover from the procrastination because everything I do, with the code or on Slack, has a timestamp, a notification, and is visible to everyone. Once there’s something I’m avoiding (committing code, deploying code, posting the code for review, responding to someone, testing code, an upcoming meeting, etc.) I often go offline from inactivity, and then I’m afraid to even open my laptop (which can take hours to overcome) because once I do everyone can see I’m online on Slack; my procrastination then is immediately visible to the people who are impacted and who are looking for it i.e. people I’m not responding to, my manager.

I already got in trouble for not doing my work, missing meetings, not responding to people for days or weeks, and just not showing up some days without telling anyone. I was put on a month-long probation, which I’ve gotten past only because I didn’t ghost entire days during that time. I have frequent meetings with my manager and I have to pretend I’m struggling way less than I am. I can’t admit that half or more of the days I do absolutely nothing, or how much communicating with people — the most important part of the job — so fundamentally terrifies me.

I know every trick in the book about procrastination, time management, breaking down tasks, but that’s not enough when I’m this afraid of people. I’ve accepted I need help from another person. I’ve talked about this some with friends, but none of them understand, so all they can provide is sympathy. I have a psychiatrist and I’ve been trying to find a therapist, but they’ve all been unhelpful, many actively harmful.

I know it's a slow process, but every single day at work is like torture, and I’m on very thin ice. Because I can’t get the work done, it’s not endurable, and I don’t have the time or energy to work on all the other parts of my life in dire need of work. I don’t want to quit because I haven’t been here that long and I had a big gap between quitting my previous job (for the same reasons). But I can’t stay like this for months until I find someone and begin making progress.

"Not sure where to start, I am finding life a constant struggle and I am tired and sick of it now. I feel like there is a massive weight crushing down on me. I cannot remember the last time I felt truly happy. I had an average childhood, my dad worked long hours so did not really build a relationship with him, my mam was the centre of the family. I suppose I will start when my family were involved in a horrific car accident, they all survived but sustained very severe injuries. My sister and mam were hurt the most, my sister was left with scars to her face but she battled through it and learn to live with it, my mam never really got over what happened to her. Life went on though and it became a memory we tried to forget. My mam then took Ill, she was diagnosed with cancer. We we all devastated but the surgeons had a plan and said they would fix it, she would survive but would need alot of surgery and rehabilitation, she went through the surgery and was on the road to recovery when she took her own life. Our world fell apart as you would imagine. She was a born worrier and I suppose the stress of it all just got too much for her. Again life went on although it was never the same again. I had my wife and children to focus on so the years passed as we carried on. I had the chance to take over and own the company I had worked at for many years so I took the opportunity to make a good life for my family,however the stress was immense and I could feel myself heading down and down into a breakdown, then I found out my wife had been having an affair with one of my best friends. This completely through me and destroyed every last thing I had in my life, I thought I could fix it, make it work with her but she no longer loved me so eventually I moved out. I set up home not far away from the family home and rebuilt my life for me and my children. I dated, had a few short relationships, then met someone who lives across the street, I thought this was the beginning of the rest of my life. Unfortunately, due to my wifes affair I now have trust issues, I find myself being controlling over my girlfriend. She continues to text her ex because they have 4 children together but this make me very anxious and causes alot of arguments between us. I have literally just told her we need to end our relationship because it is making me unhappy. To top this all off my sister has just been diagnosed with bowel and liver cancer, we were told its unlikely that its totally curable and that treatment will only slow it down. She adopted her son as a baby, hes now 9 years old, she is a single parent. My dad is not in the best of health but not life threatening, hes diabetic and struggles to control his sugar. I can see my life heading down a path I have no control over, I may lose my sister and dad over the next few years, I will be then responsible for raising my sisters adopted son, I have to work long hours to make ends meet but I do ok. I just feel like my whole like is falling apart and I am all alone. My kids are great but I only see them part time. Being completely honest they are the only thing keeping me going now but I am afraid that the way I feel that they might not be enough. I do not know what to do.

"I dont know what happened to me 

Hi, currently I am not diagnosed, I hope it does not bother anyone, but bipolar type 2 is being suspected by my psychiatrist. And I had some doubts (I'm not asking for diagnosis) because lately I have been going through dark days, but today something extremely strange happened to me that I do not know how to name or explain to my psychiatrist. If anyone has felt this way, I would appreciate it if you could tell me about your experience please. 

I was talking with a friend about my emotions, and I remember that from one moment to the next I got caught up in a specific thought (like a delusion). And then it was like I had emotionally exploded, I felt out of myself, I started sobbing very loudly, my breathing was heavy, I couldn't control or stop myself. But it wasn't like the moment or the conversation led me to it because of the intensity, it just happened. I was hugging myself, I couldn't stand him touching me. I felt like I was getting small. I really have no idea how to explain it, but what was most impressive to me was how spontaneous it was and that feeling of not being in control of my own body. After that i felt numb and confused.",Bipolar,"{""category"": ""Bipolar""}",2025-04-21 04:40:27.369284,e5-large-v2

"Turning into alcohol Hey all. I'm getting worse. I've been battling depression ever since I finished high school, and it's been progressively getting worse. I thought getting a girlfriend would fix it, it doesn't. Nothing seems to help. I've come to realize life is pointless and it doesn't matter what I do to myself. I've been hurting myself, cutting, etc. and lately I've started drinking.

 It started with just a couple of nights of drinking on holiday. Then I realized hey I kind of like alcohol. Started to have a couple of beers a few times a week. Now I'm having them every night and bought my first large case of them ""just in case"" I wanna  have some beers the next night. 

I know this is a step to the worse and that I could stop right now with minimal discomfort. I just really don't care anymore and I want someone to notice I'm not okay because I can't really talk about it myself to the people I know. At the same time I don't want this to turn into full blown alcoholism because that would be bad, but at the same time I don't know if I even care that much anymore.

If I didn't have my family I would more than likely end my life.

"So all of this began like a month ago. I was in the process of getting out of a depressed situation and was finally getting better. However right as this was happening a chain of terrible misfortunes started happening to me. First I broke my finger and almost poisoned myself in the same day. I am like whatever, shit day but it happens right? So a few days pass and I had pretty much fixed my mood from the shit day and I realized something was wrong with me (it is kind of private so I will not go in detail) but I googled it and it turns out it is a cancer syndrome. I instantly talked to a doctor but he said it I would have to wait a while for him to be available. So I spend the next 2 weeks torturing myself mentally imagining the worst case scenarios to a point where i prepared a knife to off myself if I was diagnosed with cancer. I went to the doctor a few days ago and the test results should be out tomorrow. I was once again starting to feel better and convincing myself that it is going to be alright when just a few hours ago I fell and broke my foot. Why are all of these bad things happening to me? Why are they all happening in such a short amount of time? I am laying on my bed in horrible pain and worrying about my foot, and tomorrow I could be diagnosed with a life threatening disease. If the test results are fine I would probably get in a car crash or something. I cannot take it anymore. When I try to tell my friends about my problems they reply with ""Sucks I guess"" or something like that, my parents do not care either. I am lonely and going thru the hardest time of my life.

I watch behind my computer screen as people go about their lives, making accomplishments and being social, while I just stay in my room and plot my useless ideas. Mostly I just want it to end. Except I have no way to kill myself and every time I have tried has not worked out? I feel most days that the cosmos is taunting me for something I did wrong, and cannot figure out how to make things better. Pain follows pain. In all, I know that I have no way out except death.Most people think that they know loneliness, but nobody knows it better than me. I have very few friends, most of all people view me as an oddity who they do not want to spend time with. I have no boyfriend or girlfriend and I am basically never going to because I am both autistic and asexual. The solitary life might not be so bad if I did not have this craving for human contact that I have had for years (I am now 22). All I long for is to go out with people but I have no way of meeting them. I was bullied in high school and had to drop out. At university, I could not seem to make any because I was too depressed by various things. Covid did not help. And so I have gotten to a stage where I feel like a complete outsider in society, hating myself and divorced from the norms of everyone else. I have very obscure interests, philosophy and literature, and art and movies. On top of that, I do not have any career both because I find it sustain one and my autism.I am an artist, except what good is that if nobody cares about my art? I have made albums of music that nobody really listened to and I was too depressed to advertise. I have also just finished a novel that nobody is going to read. I thought for the past few years that I could express the unique aspects of how I view the world through art, but I do not think it matters. Nobody is interested in me. I could self-publish my book and then nobody will read it. And so I feel constantly invisible, like a ghost that walks through people embedded in the world. I have been forgotten; I do not belong here; I am just a strange cosmic absurdity.And so what are my options in life, go on every day in perpetual misery and loneliness having had many years of proof that nothing gets better? I have no hope, and I can see myself in 10 years being in the exact same state of misery. I cannot bear the thought of continuing on this road, the endless pain.

I am physically and mentally exhausted and I just really do not have the strength to go on. Everything hurts so bad. It never stops. I thought it would years ago.

"For anyone on the fence about journaling, this is my experience so far... So I enjoy journaling for a few different reasons, and as I continue to do it, and get better at it, the more natural it feels, allowing you to really make use of it and get something out of it. Before this recent journaling expedition I had NEVER journaled.  Maybe stupid little doodles and quotes from songs or something in notebooks, but not really journaling, or for any real purpose.  I was somewhat curious and interested in the idea, as it had always been suggested to me by programs, institutions, therapists, etc..  however, I couldn't get past my biggest hurdle which was how to begin journaling without feeling really, really, silly, or like some teeny girl in highschool writing about people she doesn't like or her crushes or whatever.  It just felt awkward and silly.  I debated on doing it for a while and I think one day I said to myself to just do it, see how it goes, and do it day after day or just twice a day, even if all I write is a sentence, or a gratitude, or a to do list, the idea was just to start doing it and developing the healthy habit.  So my first entries were very crude.  I'm looking at one now and it basically says : 

THC NJ is COOL
APPLY TO JOBS
START NEW RPG
GONNA COOK STEAK
START READING DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? (finished it that week)
THIS IS MY 1ST TIME JOURNALING
MAY ADD MORE LATER, lol
TALKED TO LILY BILLY, need to more often

Then l stated a short gratitude for the day.  This first journal entry I was grateful for reddit, cause I believe I made a post prior to writing that entry asking for tips on how to journal.  I posted on a few mental health groups, a few addiction or drug based subs, and a few writing subs and got all sorts of helpful tips, but my first few entries remained pretty crude for a week or so.  My first entry was on 2-12-23. So I've been doing it almost daily, some days multiple times in one day, and some weeks I'll go 3 or 4 days without journaling like just recently, but I don't like doing that cause now I notice a sort of disconnect from myself when I don't journal habitually.  It's constant confirmation of all your thoughts and beliefs, and you see how your idea develop and progress.  Thinking something and thinking something then writing it down on paper, physically putting the idea into the universe helps establish it.  

I skip a week or so into my journaling and now I'm talking to it more like how traditionally people think journaling goes.  Like raw free thought sort of, that's definitely a very important part of journaling though you can and will develop your own entire journaling style based on your needs, or what you want out of it.  I thought I would hate the free thought aimless formula but it's what I use the most now, because the habit of writing allowed me to get comfortable with it and explore it's benefits.   I just moderate it by USUALLY including short term, or long term goals, gratitudes,or something. But not always, if you don't feel it you shouldnt force yourself.  You don't wanna say a bullshit gratitude just to write something for gratitude.  If you don't feel it don't write it.  So yeah fast forward in my journal and I'm talking about the day we went to the park after group and we smoked a bit and played football and frisbee and saying how nice it is, before that  some goals and gratitudes.  Short term goals.  I begin to write about accomplishments I've made and things I see different in myself.  I talk about some of my inner growth but I'll mention a specific think like in how the past year and a half I've been fucked up like 20 of those days.  Or how I feel my brain is finally begin to repair itself cause I can feel some sort of natural euphoria at times.  Dopamine release is finally becoming more regulated.  I'll write how I finished a book in a week and that's also an accomplishment.  A big accomplishment I had to write down was hygiene.  When I was in heavy active addiction, or even sober just severely crippled with depression I'd go a month without brushing my teeth, weeks without showering.  So I wrote down that accomplishment.  It effects self esteem, ego and confidence.  When you go back and read goals you had and accomplishments you've made, on a daily basis you get to physically see growth or change in yourself instead of just feeling you're doing better.  You have written proof, you're logging your mental state everyday and you go back after a month when you forget what you wrote and you're like oh shit wow, I can't believe I actually accomplished that, or shit I can't believe I even WANTED. To accomplish that.  Being able to go back and read what you wrote after you forgotten it is a visceral feeling.   Theres no real WAY to journal and I'm still figuring out my best way but it changes, some days it's free thought, one day it's lists and goals and gratitudes, sometimes a healthy mix, sometimes it's something funny that happened that day (good to go back and read on funny moments you'd otherwise completely forget about, it can immortalize them so to speak) sometimes it's topics I wanna go down rabbit holes on YouTube and I'll mention it in the journal so that if I forget I'll  come back to that page on my own at some point and remember.  I could imagine how amazing it would be to have years worth of your own personal journals now.  Must be pretty fucking cool.  Get to see huge change in yourself and never forget where you started.  Reddit gave me an overwhelming amount of GOOD information and I took what I thought would work for me, still plan to read more on journaling tips soon as I wanna evolve it further and do more for with it, but I've been doing it for a like a little over a month so ill keep learning and adding journaling objectives as I continue doing it.  All in all journaling serves to strengthen your relationship with yourself.  I know my explanation wasn't the best, so I recommend also searching reddit or Google on your own for more journaling tips that work for your needs.

"Health issue or health anxiety So before i start, let me make clear that i do have some health issue Well had, i was born with a unicuspid valve and had open heart surgery 2 years ago. Up to the surgery i was a mental wreck more than before. Now after the surgery ive been Well for the most part. I have had alot of fears after that actually got worse over the two years instead of better. Now to start This story up we gotta rewind a few months, its a few days after Christmas, im at granny inlaw having a good time, when My  girlfriend notice My right ankle is a little swollen above the achilles tendon, we call the emergency eoc and he wants ud to Come in, he frels it and want it scanned with ultrasound. It was fine. Now i didnt Think much of it then, but im sure My ankle above the achilles always was swollen but i havent ever really looked much at My ancles.
Now here is where it gets difficult two days later we Are home, i wake up and notice i have a coin sized point bit left from My sternum with minor pain,and I get spells of dizziness.
At night i get admitted to the ER and they do ultra sound, ekg, bloodwork work etc. And everythings fine, except from slightly elevated troponin which could be scar tissue, though they think i have a minor infection in my heart and release me sayinf i should be fine sfter some time but i dont feel fine. Onde home i get This feeling  of not being able to get enough air when I breath. A week later im back in the ER, they do the  usual checks plus a ct and guess what, im fine except for the same slightly elevated troponin and they release me Again sayings its just a minor infektion. 
3 weeks later i have an appointment with a specialised cardiologist that is educated for valve disease and has byen following me for over a decade. She checks me and im fine My heart is in a good condition. Now i didnt feel happy when told so, but extreme dissapointment, i started to get a feeling of fear of Them having made a mistake or missed something . The reason being is that before My surgery the hospital i was in the ER at, didnt see that My heart wasnt doing Well when I was in for chest pain(wasnt a heart attack, but My valve failing badly) the Same pain i have Now. 
Now i startede going to a psych every third week and its good. But at this point im uncertain of what is wrong, ive been checked at the hospital 3times and at a specialized cardiologist, and they havent found much that could explain the pain.
So im trying to accept the fact it could be anxiety driven, but the moment i started trying it, i got issues with breathing Again. Its like something in me wants to keeper me in pain and afraid.

"Feeling very lonely Today I saw a Snapchat of around 6 coworkers having a bday party for my other coworker, who I considered a friend.

"Being up north in a cabin in the woods, snow and pines all around. Alone, trees and mountains all around. Alone. Crossing the room, the floorboards creaking under foot, the weight of my footprints are one last mark alive on this earth. The cold wind hitting the walls of the outside. Pulling a handgun out from the drawer in the corner. Placing it in my mouth, or on the side of my head? on my temple? whichever way it is with full intentions to pull the trigger. Am I really meant to stay alive? Was told to stay alive, but for what? Only to create more misery? The ones who have said it disappeared in the wind. To stay alive to not exist? To live only to wish to end this misery, wishing to end this thing called living? We all meet the earth in our deteriorating bones eventually. I have no legacy. I will be forgotten like the ones before me. I think these things as I am pressing the ball of the barrel to my temple. I think of him, who first said to me to stay alive even though he disappeared and said to never call back. Why am I still here? I want to cry, to scream to take this pain away. Am I really going to give in to living or just end it all? TAKE THIS PAIN AWAY! End MY MISERY! I lower the gun and fold into a ball. The gun lay at my head, the gun laying in full sight. I stare at it, conscious of the outside, the wind shifting frame of this cabin. I close my eyes and pray I no longer want to be alive. To fall asleep. To wake up alive. I want to die!

"i’ve had a rough week :/ this is literally just me going to vent bc i don’t have anyone rn and i feel like talking to a community that knows what i might be going through is more comforting than talking to people who i know aren’t going to get it or will worry them. 

so last Thursday my friend and I got into a big fight over me not answering my phone , the jist of that is i was called selfish and told i throw a pity party for myself every time I talk about my relationship with my mother ( it’s bad and has only gotten worse as im am adult now ) as well as her insinuating that i undermine their relationship with their parents ( which i do not , because that is not the type of person i am for whatever that’s worth ) and it ended with us blocking each other which is something i initiated bc I couldn’t deal with how uncommunicative she was being it alone interfered with a lot of other plans, like us going to prom together so now im torn about even going to that since it’ll be my senior prom but then the idea of being outside is to much 

so that Monday was my birthday and I had invited two other friends of mine , one of which I was supposed to be moving in with and had been planning to do so for years only for her to tell me the night i turn 18 that she doesn’t see it being realistic , which is fair and I’m not angry with her but it just seems like my life is falling apart , and I know in the future this won’t even matter but i am having borderline suicidal thoughts and can feel my depression getting so ugly that I can’t even look in mirrors or think about my future. 

i feel really lost and I’m trying to stay positive and have my perspective be that of gratitude but I’m struggling and im just so fucking scared about what I’m going to do in my life. I was thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend but I can’t even trust that the thought is mine or just my brain going into overdrive. I can’t even look people in the eye anymore . I just want to sleep and I want to run away and just go somewhere but I know that’s my avoidance talking. 

don’t really know why im posting this , i think maybe I want to hear about your stories of overcoming things and getting to where you are now or just to know somebody else understands.",Bipolar,"{""category"": ""Suicidal""}",2025-04-21 04:47:49.523764,e5-large-v2
"I hope this makes you feel better Society expects us to have kids, house, nice car and a “successful” career to be “happy”.

We’re brainwashed into following this “dream” right from school and put ourselves through great deal of stress pain and suffering.

Unless you’re born into wealth you have to give your life away and work for someone else’s dream with the tales that one day you will have the same amount of wealth and along the way you’re reminded how far away you are and compare yourself to others that have just that bit more than you.

You sacrifice your life, freedom, health, relationship all for some pocket change and a supposed wealth while others are milking from your sacrifice this making you feel like a failure, feeling like that dream is further and further away.

It’s a mindset you need to teach yourself, a mindset where your head is clear and at every obstacle you need to tell yourself no matter what it is that you’ll be fine because LIFE IS TOO SHORT AND CAN CHANGE IN AN INSTANT and then when your health suffers all of these aspirations and dreams do not matter.

I’ve been incidentally diagnosed with cancer - was very lucky as they’ve cut it out fairly quickly, only 3 nights in hospital, painless procedure. I’ve won a lucky dip with life because it was nothing, but seeing people who care about me being so upset was a horrible experience.

I wanted them to be happy and stop worrying because I’ve never thought much of myself then why would they? Because I am nothing, I am not worth anything, low self esteem, never had any aspirations, goals, only liked cars, wasn’t very social, couldn’t really talk to people and sat in my own head alot.

Showing how much those close to me cared for me made me change. When I lay in hospital my head was clear, didn’t worry about work, buying a house, savings or career. Only my family mattered and that’s how I’ve learned this mindset and began adapting my life around it, got rid of as much finance as I could, paid off my phone, sold the BMW bought a cheap Fiat for cash. Financial freedom helped with not worrying about money. Began saving money for a deposit for my new house in the future.

I keep reminding myself to enjoy the little things in life, going for a walk, going to a gym or even buying something fancy to eat here and there on my weekly shop, going restaurant and getting a carbonara or a new phone case. I’ve started eating healthy and looking after my health. I feel happy, proud of myself and I live week by week.

Of course I am aware I am very lucky and not everyone has the same opportunities in life and do not wish to upset anyone by this post. I hope this helps someone to find their path in life.",Stress,"{""category"": ""Normal""}",2025-04-21 04:47:56.583435,e5-large-v2

She called me crying and sobbing loudly from the hospital yesterday. She told me that she told him he did not want to be with her anymore. She basically crumbled. Her mom called me today and told me that she tried to take her life but they found her in time. I really dislike the boyfriend, if I am honest, I have never been a fan of him. Hes always seemed off to me, distant. But as her friend I always made the effort to support her decision to be with him. Right now she is still hospitalized and crying inconsolably. Her psychiatrist is traveling to where she is (she is out of town, about 18 hours driving away). I feel really sad that i cannot be there for her and her mom.

"Friends Is it normal to constantly worry about my actions around my  friends?

I [M] started worrying about whether my friends, or at least my general ones, were just about putting up with me. I feel as if I am unwanted around people I consider friends. Conversations seem to start with being lightly involved ( since I'm present at the start) and seem to be directed at other people, say I was with 2 others they would talk between themselves. 
I may be overreacting which is probably the case but it seems when playing football during breaks at school, I seem in no way involved like my other friends are.
People I like as friends seem to disregard me in most things, for example if I had a group project of some description with groups of 6, I seem to be the 7th person constantly.

I also feel that I do not want to let go of my friendships, how rough it may be on me, due to me having no other people to turn with.
I don't want to be alone, that seems like a bad life to lead but again it appears that sometimes, for others sake not just mine, me distancing myself from them would not be bad.

This does tie into r/stress in a way that I am not myself but the person others want me to be, constantly aware of my actions, hardly any of them I would do of my own accord. It is sometimes tiring.",Stress,"{""category"": ""Anxiety""}",2025-04-21 04:51:47.584367,e5-large-v2

"I have recently looked into reddit and found that this place is actually quite healthy and supportive... I did not know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...I do not think I have much to say, but I look very young for 26 and it seems that is a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened, I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that did not require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story does not sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I do not have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations, but I do not have a circle of friends that is interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or self-promoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I do not promote? Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free, but it is quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason, I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like that is a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways, I do not really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anti-capitalist/materialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk, you would not be ghosted. End: I really do not like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I cannot see that these people are actually hurting inside, but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar.

"Is it good to only focus on 1 goal? What I mean is, for example I have these goals:

1. Find a good job OR start and grow a succesful company
2. Find the one who will marry me in the future
3. Find out which religion is the true one / read the whole bible

So my idea is, I will only work towards one goal at the same time. If I choose goal 1 and I choose to study or gain work experience, then I will not read the bible and I will not be on dating apps, because I should not overwhelm myself and risk a burn-out. If I choose goal 2, I will be very busy with dating apps and alternatives, but I will not have a job and I will not be studying. If I choose 3, I will read the bible a few hours every day, but I will not do any other productive things.

What is the good side of this by my own thought?

1. Whichever goal is the most important one, OR has to be completed the fastest, can get priority and full focus :)
2. By only having one thing to work on, you have less risk of ending up with 0 free time, so you can avoid burn-out and instead, work at your own pace. (careful: do not get lazy)

What is the bad side of this by my own thought?

1. Spending hours everyday on the same goal only, can become boring. Some goals also do not require many hours every day: for example going to the gym. Being in the gym for 5 hours is a terrible idea, so if you have goals that require less time per day, you can actually pick 2 or 3 of these goals to fill your day.
2. Some goals must be worked on at the same time. For example, you should not avoid studying because you're too busy with going to gym. But while you study, going to the gym is still important for your health. So I would call this an exception to this ""1 goal only"" idea.

These days it seems socially acceptable that people do 3 things at the same time: study, have a job, have a social life. Where's the free time to relax? Right it doesnt exist, and even worse, sometimes all these activities take up more than 24 hours a day, which results in someone being overwhelmed and getting behind on everything. Actually this is what I have experienced. Its not a theory, it is very real.

I have a burn-out. I have been stressed 24/7 for a really long time, because I was focusing on too many things at once. I had to get my homework done, I had to spend all my free time on dating apps, I had to go to gym, etc, I had no free time left.

So my plan is to only work on one goal at once, and spend all free time as actual free time, to relax or enjoy it.

"I think I am depressed. I decided to type out and share some of my feelings and thoughts in order to get them off my chest and to hopefully receive some helpful advice or encouraging words from one of the people reading this.I was raised as a Christian and I was a believer until my early teenage years. Then, a relative of mine passed away, very suddenly, from cancer. She was still in her thirties. It made no sense to me. She was a very generous, sweet, hospitable, warm and loving woman. It made me question if there is a god and why he would allow something like this to happen to such a good person. The death of my relative turned me into a bit of a hedonist. My reasoning: Why would I do tedious things, if something like this can happen to anyone? What is the point in studying for a boring test when I could die tomorrow? I knew that the chances of me dying were slim, but there are never guarantees.Then, I identified as an agnostic atheist for a few years, before I finally became an atheist a few years ago. I am now at a point where I believe our existence is merely a coincidence. We are just descendants of monkeys on a tiny blue rock and the unfortunate tragedy is that we can reflect on our own existence. I am the kind of person who tries to make sense of everything. I usually try to be as unbiased as possible and to use facts in order to form my opinion. That is why it is so hard for me to come to terms with the fact that life is very unfair and random.By making smart choices (living healthily, working hard, etc.), you can only increase your chances of living a good life, but there are no guarantees. Our 1 and only life is a game of chance, which is a truth that is hard for me to fathom.The state of the world pisses me off too. Why the fuck is there still racism? Why are LGBTQIA+ people still being treated unfairly? Why are we allowing capitalism, overconsumption and greed to completely destroy our planet? Why are there billionaires? Why are millions of people starving, while others care about buying the latest clothes and gadgets? How am I supposed to care about school when these problems still exist? Perhaps I am just a sensitive little bitch, idk.Speaking of being a bitch, I fucking love my parents and I cannot stomach that someday, they will die. I start crying even just thinking about losing them at some point in the future. I genuinely believe they are some of the best human beings on the earth. I have thought about suicide but I do not think I would be able to do that to my parents, who are my everything. So the harsh reality is that either I will lose them, or they will lose me. So, if I do not want to commit suicide, it is inevitable that I will lose my parents at some point (if I manage to live that long) and that I will have to continue to live life on a planet full of greed and hate. A life that is inextricably linked to suffering. I have heard people say time and time again that life IS suffering, but even when that is seen as a universal truth, that does not mean that it becomes easier to accept that truth. That truth does not suddenly become easier to bear.I have briefly read about Camus (and the myth of Sisyphus) and while I agree with his worldviews and the absurdity of life, I cannot really see myself following the example of Sisyphus. I cannot see how I could accept having to roll the boulder up the hill for the rest of my life.For a few years, the idea of building a legacy intrigued me. What if I could make art or start institutions that could stand the test of time. My name would be cemented in history. Then, I had a shocking realisation. When I die, I will not be there to enjoy the legacy I built. I do not know what to do. I still enjoy sports, hedonism and other forms of escapism, but only because they allow me a temporary escape from life's inherent suffering. Perhaps I am a 'pussy' or a 'coward' but I honestly cannot take it anymore. This existence is overwhelming.

"TLDR; bf is getting more depressed over time. I am trying so hard to get him the help he needs. I am getting pushed away and its affecting my mental health now. I feel like everything is pointing towards us breaking up.we have been dating for about 1.5 years. I have GAD and moderate/mild depression. I am currently on medications and in therapy. He has severe depression (and anxiety I suspect), and has been in therapy before. Hes going back to therapy, but there were not any availabilities until August. He has a history of getting depressed in relationships (previous two gfs and me).He and I have similar histories. Both our families had pretty nasty divorces. Both of our mothers developed cancer while we were still young teenagers. Our families are in similar geographic regions. We both had a relationship that was emotionally abusive. I guess I mention these because it was easy for us to understand each other when we first met, but also because I think these could have impacted our mental developments and relationships.Both my partner and I are in graduate school. He has a major exam coming up that determines if he will qualify for candidacy. This exam has been looming for a while and has been pushed back a couple of times because of COVID, but also because he was not prioritizing preparing for it. This stressor is contributing to his depression.The other stressor is our relationship. Its been on the rocks for a couple of months now. He left to visit family in May and he was not in the mood to have sex when he came back. I miss the sexual intimacy, but I am much prefer physical affection and emotional intimacy. Having said that, its always been hard for him to open up to me. In June, he did something that really upset me at the time, which started his spiraling. I have since forgiven him, but I do not think hes forgiven himself. He admitted hes been depressed for a while now. I did not see the signs very well and attributed it to stress from his exam (before I knew our relationship was also stressing him out). He said a lot of self-hate things and started punching himself in the face. I called his dad and told him what is going on because I felt like I could not be his only support. we have been in limbo (how he described it) since June. We did not see each other much the first couple of weeks because we both needed space. After that, I have been the one initiating contact and hanging out to get a feel for things. we have been telling we love and miss each other still. However, he told me this weekend that the physical affection is hurting him and he was not comfortable with me going to our mutual friends because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. For 4th of July, he also did not act like my boyfriend.This really hurt me but I have been trying to listen to his needs more because of his depression. Hes asked for more space to focus on school, which also hurts but I do the same when I need to get work done. I have tried to get him into our schools counseling between now and his regular therapist, but he does not want to talk to a new therapist. I have also tried to get him to couples therapy. He said he would go, but its obvious he does not want to be there, so I have not scheduled anything because I do not think it would be productive if he does not want to be there. I have asked if I can help him around his house because he is not taking care of himself. I have asked how can I support him, which was the space mentioned above.He does not know what he wants in regards to us. I do not know if its the depression talking. Hes scared if we have an on and off relationship that I will eventually leave him for good because an ex did that. Hes thinks I am disappointed in him (I have never said this, he sets these expectations for himself) because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. I feel he does love me because 1) friends and his family have told me he loves and cares about me very much, 2) he showed it through his actions before all of this, 3) he told me he loves making me happy. But, my doubts have been creeping in. He said his depression is getting worse. He does not want to see me, I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I cannot tell him how this is affecting me without him spiraling, and I just feel like I keep hurting him when I am trying my best to help him. I cannot help but think his feelings for me have changed.I love him so much for so many reasons. I loved him early on in our relationship but I wanted to be sure it was real and not infatuation, so I did not say anything until maybe 9 months in. I wish he could see what I see. But him pushing me away is hurting me and affecting my mental health now. My anxiety is through the roof and I can feel my depression starting.I am not exactly sure what I am looking for from you guys, but thanks for reading if you made it to the end.

"Feels kind of weird posting about this on Reddit, but if it helps then I might as well.I am 16 years old, depressed, and was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome at age 6, along with being tested for autism multiple times (none of them came back, and I am fairly certain I am not on the spectrum, or at least not noticeably) and Asperger's once. I had an abusive stepfather for about 9 years, from when I was 3 to when I was about 11-12. I have just finished my GCSEs, and I am waiting on my grades. I have always been a high achiever, always been placed on ""gifted and talented"" lists, always used to bury myself in science textbooks and documentaries. Back before I had access to the Internet, my education was almost a coping mechanism. Still, now it feels like a lot of other people deserve their academix success a damn sight more than I do. Compared to a lot of people on this subreddit, I should be incredibly lucky. But I do not think my luck can be much worse. I am in a friends with benefits type relationship with a girl that I have loved for about 2 years, and we still love each other, but I used to talk to her about all of my depression and suicidal tendencies and now we have got a strict rule that I cannot talk to her about it anymore. Which tbf is for the best. That does not mean it does not hurt though. I guess my main problem is that I feel isolated almost all the time. Even in a room of people I feel like I am alone. Sometimes even when I am with her. Back when I had that abusive stepfather, I remember sitting in my room, in a corner, too afraid to leave or even move until my mum came home. I have grown up since then, but on the inside that is still how I feel. I have gone through countless friend groups who do not give a shit about me, I have only ever found three or four ""real"" friends yet I feel awful telling them about anything I have experienced or I am feeling. I tried to tell my teachers that they were putting me under too much stress, and then they decide to tell my mum, when I asked them not to. Queue me being treated like an alien for weeks. I have written countless rants, suicide note drafts, sad monologues, and it is getting tiring. The suicidal stuff gets terrifying sometimes... I have a massive fear of death, but I do not want to keep on living in this kind of world. I am not always suicidal, and to be honest today has been a really good day for me. But it is not like that makes it go away. Sometimes I am scared of what is going to happen to me in X amount of years. In fact, that is pretty much all of the time. As I get older, I start to realise that my childhood is slowly slipping away from me, and that I should probably enjoy what is left of it as much as I can, yet... I do not think I have ever really enjoyed my childhood. I am going to stop there, since I would be here for days otherwise. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

"I made a friend for the first time since middle school when covid hit I became very isolated since I was doing school online but last school year I went back in person and there was this person that would approach me but I was too shy to really talk to him and I finally built up the courage this last september to actually approach him. I've gotten really close with him and I am so fuckin glad I befriended him. He's really loving, kind and patient. He's assertive, out there and also very protective while I'm very quiet, meek and also generally on edge and easily spooked so he balances me out and calms me very well. I can tell he cares very deeply about me and he's accepting of my differences. I told him about my avpd and he has been very understanding and helpful. His attitude and actions have given me a really big confidence boost in our friendship and just in general. I feel a lot more comfortable just existing and taking up space.

"Male 21 years old You may not be able to understand all of this as English was not my first language.I should have lived my life happier. I choose to be alone because I always thought that you can do everything even by yourself. I ignored my friends, kept pushing that I will be ok by myself. Father left when I am just a child. Mother who worked too hard to the point where it feels like I have no parents. I got bullied when I was a kid and it made it hard for me to approach others. Even my own brother bullied me. It started when I was 8 years old. Bullying only stopped when I got to Senior High School 17 years old. Got called weird by my classmates every time. I went to different school just so I can start again but it only made it worse enough for me to attempt suicide two times. High expectation of relatives became stress and pressure for me. I had some who I should have talked to more or socialized with more but because I do not know how to, it ended with me not being able to respond making it seem like I am ignoring them and that is how I still have no friends. I always wear this fake smile on my face to not gather the attention of the teachers when I am at school. No one noticed or no one tried to ask. I tried getting help from a psychiatrist but it is not going that well. I just cannot explain why I am feeling sad or empty. I watch anime sometimes to provide myself temporary happiness but makes me feel more lonely because I have no one to talk to about things I like. I tried to befriend others but I end up talking too much and they get weirded out by me. All of this made me not want to go outside my house and made me feel like others judge me whenever they look at me. Random people I do not know why but I am scared of others stares. I do not want to be seen. I just want to disappear. I wish i could turn back time and redo all my mistakes to correct them.

"I think I have bone cancer Im 20 years old (male) and im 6' 3"" 170 lbs

Let me start of by saying that for most of my life i think i have symptoms and i think im gonna die everytime untill i finally go to the doctor aand find out its some minor problem.

Ok so in spring of 2015 i noticed the muscle above my knee was twitching a lot so i got into the habit of feeling that area every day until i noticed a hard lump developing on my bone. I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.

Two years later (this last summer) i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painful/tender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.

Anyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.

My pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs  and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.

I usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds (in muscle) over the last 6 months.

What i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?

And for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town.

"This is kind of just ganna be a thought dump I guess, but its something I need to put somewhere so it is not festering in my head.I do not really understand myself anymore. I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, ""I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad"" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just 'in a mood'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that. I wonder if she would show up to my funeral. there is honestly a lot more I would like to share, but I do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so I will wrap it up. I want to see a doctor, I need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive. I want medication, BUT I cannot GET IT. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I do not want to look up how I can die painlessly anymore. I do not want to debate how much longer I want to give myself anymore. I wish I lived in Sweden or somewhere that had euthanasia, that is not as scary as a gun and a rope. I want to fix my brain.I am sorry. I know stuff like this does not really help those that feel the same, but I needed to put it somewhere. I needed to exist beyond my house.

"I cannot help to feel sorry for feeling suicidal almost every day in the past 3 years. Every day I woke up, the PTSD kicks in and it will repeat my mistake vividly. It took so much of my energy just to combat that PTSD, let alone the suicidal thought. The flashback is so real, and often leaves me with an accelerated heartbeat and a wet pillow when I wake up.I am not sure if feeling suicidal is a sure sign of depression or not. But I know that in my calm mind, that whenever the PTSD or the memory flashback kicks in, I will start to plan for suicidal methods. How I wish I can enjoy a painless death.......I know, I am sick. But I lives in a very conservative society. Suicide is a taboo topic in here and nobody would really talk about that. As a man, I know I am ""not supposed to feeling suicidal"", as this will show that I am vulnerable. I know being vulnerable is a huge weakness in this market, everyone will hits your weak point to achieve maximum benefits. I know I cannot afford to be vulnerable. I know I live in the stereotype image. Today, because of pure coincidence, I am forced to work with someone that happens to be the main character in my PTSD. She was kind, never mentioned any of my past mistakes. but before she left, she say something to me in private. This caused my PTSD and suicidal thought to be in peak. But since I am working (as a videographer), I need to display a professional image. I cannot display my personal emotion in front of client.It was only until when I am back to home and finally be alone. I slump into the bed, feeling no appetite to eat. The thought to end my life was the strongest I ever encounter. The only motivation is to seek death, so I open up my laptop, searching for any new drug that can be purchased discreetly to end my life painlessly. You know, whenever you google up suicide, there will always be a hotline number. I doubt it actually works. They will eventually say that, ""in the end you still need to rely on yourself"". I am no stranger to a suicide thoughts, and I am getting tired to all these anti-suicide campaigns. I really doubt it is helpful, especially for someone likes me that could not talk properly about my mental issue. Today is not my first suicide attempt, and I doubt it will be the last suicide attempt in my life. The PTSD and suicide leave such a permanent disability in my mental capacity. Sometimes I wish I can be dead, and sometimes where I feel so lucky not to suicide at that point. I had been trapped into this ""tried to suicide, failed, glad I am not dead"" cycle. I feel so tired and drains out to combat with these negative thoughts. I had long lost the courage to lives on. I can only use new goals to excites myself. Quite similar in dark souls, once you finish your duty, you are bound to ""die"" (literally). I am really sorry for the negativity. I am so scared to talk about this with anyone. This had been my deepest secret that I could not share with anyone. I felt really guilty that while I am feeling suicidal, there are thousands of people in the hospital who struggle to live on. How I wish I can ""transfer"" my lifespan to them..... They can just live on with my life, while I die (happily, I hope so).

A year ago, he had shown interest in maybe us becoming more than friends, but it was pretty clear that he changed his mind about it quickly. He started treating me differently (talking down to me, being short, not controlling his temper) and I started really feeling shitty about myself. I have a lot of codIm 29 going on 30, and I have a lot of issues. I have no contact with my family (my dad died in a car accident, and my grandmother of cancer. Both within a month of eachother. The rest of my family are assholes), two of my closest friends stopped talking to me because of my mental health, I am paying for an apartment I cannot afford, and I graduated recently with a degree in art where tbh, I am mediocre at best. Right now, I am waiting tables and having to fake all of my emotions every fucking day and really sell that I care about someone is lunch taking too long. I feel like I cannot really make art, or even enjoy making art, because my depression has gotten so bad. Its been so hard to motivate, and I feel like a fucking loser. I am barely sleeping. I work, I go home, I lay on the couch till the sun goes down. At this point, I cannot even listen to music or watch tv anymore because the anxiety of feeling like a worthless pos kicks in, so most of the time I just lay here and do nothing. I am really self conscious about where I am, I feel stuck, and I do not know how to get out of the hole I am in.I drink alone now. I did not even drink until about two years ago. Honestly, I do not even really like alcohol that much, it just makes the time go by and makes me not want to eat. I am uncomfortable in my body and have always wanted to be skinny and pretty, and never have been either of those things.So I stupidly and drunkenly called him, and asked what it was exactly that made him change his mind about me. He basically validated everything that I have been feeling; that I have no drive, no motivation, and that I have just gotten comfortable. I do not know why I did it, but I told him I had to go, grabbed an xacto, and cut my leg. I had to call out of work for two days because the wound was not really healing, and I did not want to go to the hospital because I am uninsured and afraid of being put on a psychiatric hold. I already have so much fucking debt. I went to work today, but it was really hard and I was in a lot of pain.I do not know what to do with myself.

"I'm so tired of trying to be okay. When I don't exercise regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to go into social settings and interact with others, especially friends, semi-regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to switch up my routine, it happens and it happens when I have no routine. It happens when I don't get enough sleep, when I don't spend enough time outside and the list goes on. It's exhausting. And while a lot of these habits/things are enjoyable in the moment, once I push past my ""but I don't wanna"" inner toddler brain, I'm so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain ""okay"".And truth be told, lately, I haven't.

Update: After writing this, briefly texting with a redditor, who was kind enough to reach out to ask if I'm okay and feeling my feelings for a bit (aka crying), I put on my workout clothes and got it over with. It didn't do much right then and there, but I also went to bed on time, to get a proper night's rest and I woke up feeling a little better. So, up and onwards I go until the next time I veer off track  managing myself. Because there really isn't an alternative.

"My [31] BF[36] of 1.5 year is generally quite a charismatic and positive person. He jokes around and can be absolutely charming. If you talked to him as a stranger you would never think he may be depressed, but I am starting to get seconds thoughts, and its breaking my heart.He grew up in a rich family with a lot of staff who helped the family with the house, and went to an expensive private school. Also he was the youngest sibling in his family, so he enjoyed a careless childhood.Then he studied, worked some years very successfully, met me. He had some relationships with women before me, but they were always somewhat traumatic or abusive. Now - i think - we have a very caring relationship. He has a very strong charismatic personality, he is manly, talented, very empathetic and smart. we have met about 1.5 years ago. For all this time till now his working hours were cut down due to corona, and he worked only 3 days a week from home, so he had a lot of free time. And besides working he has done all the same things for 1.5 years. He smokes, reads social media, watches series (most of them hes seen before), eats. He has insomnia. He often wakes up tired in the morning. His work is frustrating for him, but he seems to feel insecure to search for another job. Recently when i jokingly said something about an old psychological trauma of mine, he answered seriously: and my trauma was having to go to work 5 days a week. And the puzzle got together in my head today. I think that as kind in a rich family he never was taucht the concept of labor of any kind, and work is actually something really unpleasant for him. His current job is especially boring and feels unnecessary. So he never really accepted that he has to go to work, its actually a trauma, and he dreads it all the time. When he learned that he has to work 5 days again, he was glum and grumpy for a whole week. I really wish he would get therapy on the matter. But I am afraid that he would think its a sign of weakness, and that the world just works this way. That everyone has his job that much... But i disagree! I feel that something is dreading and exhausting him all the time! and i think its fear that he has to work, and he will have to do it for many more years. I love him.

I work in an urgent care and I got reprimanded. The first one was when I found a woman bleeding on the ground right outside the clinic and I went inside to get help because I could not lift her by myself. I told the PA and everyone pretty much rushed outside except me and one other person because I just got there and had to put my stuff down. But they think I completely ignored the patient and walked by them when I was the one who found her and got help. The reason I did not go with them was because someone had to keep seeing the patients. They were backed up already and there were 5 people already going outside to help her that it would have made no sense for me to go with them. They did not even try to clear things up with me. They just assumed that I did not want to help and told my supervisor which is bullshit. They think I am horrible because of a misunderstanding. And then I messed up by not putting the patient in the bed when putting an IV in. They fainted and started convulsing which could have hurt them badly if they hit their head. I know I screwed up big time and I just cannot get over it. I was going to go part time once school started in fall. But now I think I should just quit.

 and also problems like I want to read something and I can read but I can't understand what I'm reading until I can picture it in my head and that's not easy either and if I can't picture it then I can too  do not understand.
 and in German I've never had any problems with grammar and such and commas and everything just happened by itself and I always wrote a 1 in dictations and now all of a sudden I've made all these grammatical errors that I've made before and still messed them up.
 and I've never had problems remembering things, but now on a ö I can't remember anything anymore.  I forget everything I'm told and I always have to imagine it before I'm told things.

I have tried reconciling that joy thorough watching people stream but it has never brought up the memory of when we were little. Thank you for helping me and mothering me when I needed it the most. I will never forget the times when we huddled up crying and embracing each other while our parents fought. It did not scar me but I hate to remember those times when our parents hurled insults back at each other. Money now seems like such a waste. But anyways I want you to know that I care for you so much. I would do anything to make you feel safe. I am the baby of the family and have always felt like the black sheep.

I missed those days when you under a year old and I was feeding, burping, bathing and changing you. I greatest moment ill never forget is when you had a big accident and poop was all over my arms but I want grossed out. I knew that was most important was to make sure you were safe and clean. I will never forget when I was giving you a bath in the sink and I turned to grab a rag on the floor and turn to see you peeing a fountain in the water and making eye contact with me and giggling. that is when I knew you were a special child with a great personality. Such a boy like your mother. I hope that you turn into a Warrior and not let anyone step in your way. You fight like a champion but you never throw the first fist or hurl the first insult.

I know of rabies, but I didn’t KNOW rabies until my dumb mind did some googling. 

If you know where the googling is going, then you understand my fear. If you don’t, just don’t worry about it. 

My dog at the time is a 13 year old German Shepherd. He is prone to seizures and would have a couple of them a year. We’ve had him for 11 years so we know how to handle the situation. He also drooled and foamed a lot in the mouth. That was his natural way. He’s been vaccinated every year as it is required in the state of New Mexico. 

I did go to urgent care and received a Tetanus shot since I was overdue on that one but my doctor told me that it’s been over 40 years since a dog had rabies in my area. so I did not receive the rabies shots. Which made me feel better honestly. For about 5 months. 

In October, my dog was put down because he was struggling to stand up and seemed like he was in pain a lot. 

In late November, I got what seemed like a week long cold. Sore throat, tired, drained and all that junk. I was sick but not terrible so I went to a concert and I started to feel worse. For some dumb reason, the first thing that appeared in my mind was rabies. And I almost panicked because of it and couldn’t enjoy the show. I went home after feeling very horrible. I couldn’t sleep, a headache kicked in, my fever rose and it’s like my mind was repeating the same scene over and over all night long and I couldn’t sleep at all. Then I woke up around 5 am with a racing heartbeat that wouldn’t slow down at all. I felt awful and was fearful about rabies. 

Since that day, I never ignored my finger where my dog bit me. I still feel pain and a minor tingling sensation where he bit me and all I can think about is if I have rabies. It’s practically on a daily basis I look at the spot. I have no idea how to get past this. It’s been 9 months since the incident and I still worry about getting it. I just can’t shake this fear out of my mind. I thought the spot where he bit me would be gone but the area is still red as if it’s been only a couple of weeks since he’s bitten me. 

I’ve tried everything, such as logic. It’s exceedingly rare in the US, most rabies cases have been from bats in the US or contracted outside. Last person to die from a dog rabies in the US was in 1974. Basically when my parents were still kids. And I’m 25 now. My dog survived the 10 day quarantine and we vaccinated him after those 10 days just in case. 

Like I can’t shake the fear. Each time my finger is in pain or even get a tingling sensation, my mind instantly jumps to that conclusion. I almost don’t care about anything else. I have stomach pains and I’m going to see a gastroenterologist about it, I really wouldn’t care if they told me I had cancer. Rabies is just something that truly sparks fear in my mind. 

I even freak out seeing bats in the sky since I work at stadiums as a camera guy. ",Anxiety,"{""category"": ""Anxiety""}",2025-04-21 04:57:07.164791,e5-large-v2

"Definitely depression, but could there be something else too? (Thanks in advance!) I'm in my early 20's, currently a full-time student, currently seeing a counselor at my university for the depression I had from October-early February.

Some background: *Had an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive father growing up

*had cycles of depression as a teen but nothing as bad as this past fall, never before gotten treatment for it.

*used to have anger issues that I've been working on and have mostly gotten better.

*I used to be and still have worries in the back of my mind about some new super bug plague wiping out humanity, apocalyptic scenarios (before dystopian books were a thing-- or at least before it was on my radar), generally was and am irritable at times (can't stand foot/leg bouncers/tappers and gum smacking--as a result I feel pretty trapped in lecture halls). Something that also seems to stand out to me is that a year or two ago I got uncontrollably angry (literally shaking mad) at my roommate for no reason and had to go on a really long walk.

Currently: During my depressed period I had foggy cotton ball brain, couldn't concentrate, trouble sleeping and staying asleep, the irritability, suicidal thoughts all the time, racing thoughts.

Early last week I kinda started feeling better, one day everything looked more vivid. That sounds weird, but color had a touch more color, bright things were more bright. The next day I was so elated and have been ecstatic each morning. Waking up has been easy for the first time in a long time. I'm not riddled with self doubt or constantly wondering if I'm annoying people by talking to them. I'm actually excited for my future. I got cheap new clothes that fit so I don't have to wear my sweatpants every day any more.

Today I woke up early, did a bunch of errands, got more clothes, ran for the first time since September, did my usual short workout routine twice, and even went to an event at my university.

It's nice to finally be happy, but it feels wrong to be THIS happy so suddenly after having suicidal thoughts all day every day.

I meant to talk to my counselor about all this this morning but she was out sick---so instead I am asking for any personal experience or thoughts on this to see if I might be way off base or not here. ",Bipolar,"{""category"": ""Bipolar""}",2025-04-21 04:57:33.743981,e5-large-v2

"Really need help here, I have struggled with feeling this way for weeks now.For the past month or so I have had little to no motivation to do anything anymore. Even writing this post requires a tremendous amount of effort. I have plenty of things to do, but I just have no desire or motivation to do anything. Going to the gym, working out, studying, learning a new skill, cooking and eating, it all just feels boring and dull to me. Some days I will force myself to go to the gym but I end up leaving because there is no energy/motivation to get through a workout. Nothing is enjoyable, besides video games and porn, but even those two things are getting really boring and do not provide me with the same amount of satisfaction any longer.I finally figured out that a large part of this problem stems from how lonely I am. I am 35 and I live with my parents. I left my job in the military because I could not take it anymore and wanted to earn my bachelors degree. I moved back in with my parents because of the pandemic, although I will return to school in the fall. I HATE living with my father, who is even more depressed/lonely/pathetic/miserable than I am. he is an incredibly toxic person to be around, and I know once I am gone and away from him I will begin to feel better.I do not know anyone where I live. I have absolutely no friends. I looked for groups to join on [meetup.com]( but nothing really interests me. Besides, going to clubs like that just seems so strange to me. I have never had a girlfriend and never had sex. I am a good looking guy who is in great shape, but I think years of watching pornography online has really harmed/damaged my brain in some way. I have incredibly high expectations in women. I am trying to stop watching porn, but it is the only thing in my life that I enjoy and look forward to. That really hurt me to say that, but sadly it is true.The worst part about this entire situation is the amount of time I am wasting sitting here doing nothing all day. I have plenty of things I could be doing, but NOTHING interests me anymore. Everything is a chore and requires a tremendous amount of effort to do.I just want to feel productive again, but I am not sure what to do.

I just want to sleep and never wake up, to not have to worry about slugging through the days that blur into one another. I feel a year could pass and it would feel as though I have not moved at all, like I am trapped inside a void purgatory. I want to sleep, I do not want to have to do this just to barely make it through each day and be crying by the time I get to bed having to think about doing it all over again.

"Becoming indifferent about relationships I haven’t been around anyone outside of my family in two weeks, and I’m really content with it. For the first time in a while, I don’t feel this overwhelming sense of loneliness because there’s nothing to compare myself to. I don’t have to worry about being asked about myself or being expected to be social. I like it this way. I don’t know what this means though. 

I’m dreading having to go back to class next week because everything I want to avoid comes back. I’m tired of the pressure that my lack of social skills and low self esteem brings.

"I have been having depression and anxiety from studying. As a student I have always tried to get the best grades possible with that i was not getting recognition from my family but was still determined to aim higher the year later i started high school with a 93 average and ended with 98 average totaling it up to 96.3. I have always thought that when i get these grades i would get a good job or congratulations from my parents but i was fully depressed when i told them about my final term grade and did not even get a good job or atta-boy which really affected me negatively and i was so sad that i had to confront my mother about this and we started crying and she said she would do better and thankfully it worked but it still lies in the back of my head wether or not if i had said this when my final grades are up she would appreciate or was my confrontation a wake up call to start appreciating me. Even my siblings notice the abandonment i get relating to my studies, where it has caused me to try and aim for the high not to be the best just to be appreciated by my parents.After all that was done in my country there are limited scholarships a person could apply to and with my grades i thought I could have easily got one and by this time i would have choices to pick from but because of covid my grades were insignificant because many students got their grades up by cheating. And there is one month left and I am still anxious if ill get the scholarship i desire and this has trully ruined my mood over the holidays and made me not care about many things i just would not bother to do anything it has been a long tire full journey of studying and not to get appreciated from anyone makes me depressed and starting to not even care about the foundation that i have built i studied and worked hard to excell at every part possible but i could not get the recognition i deserved either from my parents or the scholarships Trauma with studies",Depression,"{""category"": ""Stress""}",2025-04-21 04:59:32.698003,e5-large-v2
"I feel so empty and don't know who I am I don't think I know what I'm looking for here. Maybe just a place where I can spew how I'm feeling out without being afraid of creating some kind of judgment or conflict. 

I have been having a growing identity crisis lately. Once I was diagnosed, my life was based around understanding my illness. Then it was about treating it. Then it became about  maintaining it. Now that I've been maintaining it for nearly two years, I feel like I've completely lost myself in the process. 

I am on disability so don't work, live in a rural town so don't have a big social circle, and I used to get into a lot of different artsy projects, but since getting on my current med cocktail that actually seems to work, I've lost all drive and desire to be creative. I even pulled my art bag out in the hopes that I would want to pick things up and get messy...but nothing. I ended up putting it behind the end table in my living room so it is out of the way. 

I spend my days exercising, taking care of my dog, cat and husband, my house, cooking and watching tv/movies. And while I am a genuine cinephile - it's not enough; I feel so empty. Nothing about my life feels worth while anymore. I can't tell my husband before I sort this feeling out because he'll take it personally and I cannot handle that kind of conflict right now. 


I literally cried myself to sleep last night (though that was provoked because right now my husband is sick with an infection for over a week and he can get a little brash when he doesn't feel well...I try not to take it personally, because it's not personal, it just can hit the right/wrong buttons). When I was showering today I was listening to music, and the song ""Try"" came on, and when Colbie Caillat sang ""You don't have to try so hard"" I just lost it. There was no trigger this time except the song. 

I've always really been interested in and invested in politics, but the way that politics have been for the last two years, I just feel like it is adding this constant weight to my heart. I am so so sad to see what has happened to our country. Everything feels like it's getting worse and I can't see the good happening in the world, anymore. So that hobby has become a very heavy emotional weight. 


I just....I just feel empty and I don't know what to do. I don't know who I am other than a woman on disability with bipolar.

And you would be wrong.&amp;#x200B;I will give you a brief overview immediate victim of favoritism within the first 3 years of life. I mean BLATANT favoritism parents divorced within those 3 years. parents stole me from each other, back and forth until Social Services stepped in first foster home gave me a short glimpse of what it was like to be cared for in the first time of my 8 years of life ended up being taken out of that home after about 6 months and put into a new one new foster mother beats me regularly, sexually abused me frequently and to top it off, keeps me locked up in a basement room with no windows, no clocks, no way to tell time. Leaving me in there for days at a time. This was frequently done over a 5 year period of my life after 5 years had passed, my father got custody of me only to treat me like a ghost. He only got me back for the SSI check. Other than that, I did not exist to him pretty much in school, I was teased a lot because I was constantly in sweats, I did not have any real clothing other than that and laundry was not done on any regular basis. Their laundry was, mine was not. already extremely socially isolated, things progressively got worse up to the point of someone physically bullying me and eventually I snapped and put him in the hospital. Made me realize what a monster I was. during the last couple years of high school, I found my high school sweetheart. We were together for 7 years. We made a son together. he is currently 17, turning 18 later this year. social services got involved in my life again claiming we had failed to get our son his shots, which we had to reschedule because her grandmother had passed on the day before the scheduled shots. So there goes a year and a half of fighting the incessant demands of social services they get into her head. Tell her she does not need me. She leaves me, takes me to court for 100% custody. At that point, I did not think I could possibly be more broken. I did not have a choice, so I just gave up and within 2 months, she had taken my son to another state to pursue some internet boyfriend she met on some backwards art site D something or another. a couple years pass and I decide to try again with someone new. Started off strong but there were a ton of issues and a lot of damage left behind from my past relationship. I could never trust her. still, she got pregnant on our second time so she had not gotten a chance to see the extent of the damage in me. I wish I could have been able to tell her to just run, run away from me. I suppose in some way, I did just not in so many words. towards the end our son was delivered as a stillborn. His umbilical cord had wrapped around his neck, killing him days before he was due. Just a few days. we split ways after this. I took the loss personally, as though it was God's way of punishing me for being the monster I was. Got super suicidal and tried dozens of times to end myself. All failed, obviously. a few more years passed after and I was still stuck on this notion that I wanted a family. So naturally, I found a new relationship and moved clear across the country just to be with her. while we were in person together, things were amazing. It was like gravity, we could not stay away from each other. But when the time came to part ways... that is when things got ugly, fast. still, we managed to make it last for nearly 5 years and she bore me another son. I wanted to be there so badly and she knew I did. We had talked about several times. I got to see my son ONCE before she decided she was going to keep him from me. Even despite the fact she knew I was going to be a good father. First her, it was just easier to not have to fight her grandparents who she lived with. So that is what she did. He was born nearly 7 years ago and I have not seen him since the day he was born. after two years of fighting with her to just be a family with me, I finally broke in the worst way I have ever broken in my life. I just gave up. She was not going to change her mind ever. So I walked away. more suicide attempts and a few months later I decided a drastic change was needed inside me. So that is what I did. I pursued self actualization and personal development and started to try to deal with all thus trauma I had experienced in this life. something clicked inside, like a burner just turned on and suddenly I started thinking differently, I became different than who I was before. The original owner of this vessel was gone and I was born. I was ready to accept that I would never have my own family, but I was not ready to give up on love so I went and found a new relationship. This one was actually pretty good. I did not accuse her of cheating ever in our entire relationship. I gave her room to do her own stuff and encouraged her to take time with her son, her friends, her family. I was being a good partner for once in my life and I was open to her, open to the idea this could last, it honestly felt like it was my forever home. I let myself actually believe in that. as you may suspect, things eventually fell apart. She pulled away from me, stopped so much as even touching me and I tried to talk with her, communicate what was going on to no avail. The day we broke up, she had gone away for 5 days saying she was babysitting her sister-in-law's dog. Well, I found out that that whole story was a lie, just from a Facebook post of her sister-in-law at home with her two children, getting ready for the weekend. in the end she said it was because I was too sensitive and too difficult to love. Those words still stick with me almost 2 years later now. at this point I am completely lost about what I want anymore. I want to have that relationship that lasts but I am not sure I can trust myself to actually even try again. So what else is there for me? I could never have my family, cannot even have a secure relationship even when I have worked so hard to be acceptable and lovable. I cannot help but feel like I am just wasting time, wasting my therapist's time all in some delusion that I will ever be worthy of love.&amp;#x200B;that is just a chunk of my iceberg. The super short, short version. I suppose that is why it is so hard for me to believe that anyone could even comprehend the things I have been through. The bottom is not where you think it is.

I never notice the down side I just knew that I felt better not moving as much  to the neglect of housework, and no  motivation to give a dam about work again I had an attitude wile when I was down almost hatting  the people I worked with and being resentful of having to work.

Only that the sunlight pricks you like shards of glass, And the chatter feels like sharpnoisesthat makes no sense to you.Suddenly, it all starts to fade. It feels like you are being sweeped into this big hole of darkness. The light passes by you, but does not touch you. There is no warmth. The chatters are now just mumbles, fading away. There is silence, but not calmness. You sit there, quietly falling into this pit of darkness. You want to scream, and you are, but it just comes off as a smile from your face.The fall is more like a pull, like being dragged with tremendous weight to the depth of the ocean; the weight of your existence, of being worthless, of being a burden, of being unloveable, unfullfilling.

Even the rock bottom breaks and now it only feels heavier, like a never ending fall.Sometimes I touch my wrist to feel the pulse. To check if I am alive.

"Anxiety Over Having Made No Accomplishments in Life I'm almost 40 so my life is nearly half over and I feel like I've done nothing with it. Especially because for some stupid reason I've placed all my eggs in one basket and insisted on becoming a successful author no matter how stupid or hard or impossible it is to do that these days. I haven't even tried to date anyone in over 10 years so though I'd like a relationship, I'm socially inept and awkward. I also have a lot of baggage not just from an abusive father but from two abusive relationships I was stupid enough to get into. At my age with my history, no one wants to even attempt to deal with that nonsense and as I said I'm inept at socializing because of my own problems. I don't have a ""career"" like my siblings. I don't have a family. I don't even have a job because of a permanent disability making it almost impossible for me to work. Though I have written several novels, they more than likely will never see anything resembling profit or commercial success. Most of my days are spent playing video games, hating my life, and writing because I'm too stubborn to give up on that dream despite every single sign telling me that I'm old, it's over, and there's no way I'm talented enough to make it work. 

I know that people will say that I shouldn't measure my success by other people or people around me but let me tell you. It's exceedingly hard to show up to family functions when all your siblings are married professionals with their own houses and you are the loser who has been single for 15 years because she can't manage to get into a relationship that's not abusive and would prefer to stay at home, alone with her cat who's gonna die soon anyway because he's old. If you want to suggest therapy or medication...I've done both. Medication isn't a fix for me and I've tried it on and off for years. Therapy has been a constant in my life since I was 18 so if you can possibly imagine it I was far worse than \*this\* before now. If anything I could \*possibly\* say it's a miracle that I've come as far as I have with recovering from abuse, dealing with addiction, an eating disorder, and my anxiety issues. Yet, at the same time, I desire things that I'm 99% sure I can never have and I know I'm running out of time.

Obviously it’s linked to the fact that I’m going to apply to a PhD and the fact that he’s a very knowledgeable man in his field, and there’s probably a bit of impostor syndrome playing. But what’s worrying me is the fact that of all the 10-12 meetings we had so far, I systematically throw up.

"I am going to share with you something that has always cheered me up and calmed me down whenever I get really anxious over my health So this sub only seems to really have posts from users describing their symptoms and trying to get diagnosed on Reddit, now if that helps you with your anxiety that's cool, however it can be counter intuitive as the whole googling and obsessing over symptoms is the actual problem we all came here to rid ourselves in the first place. So I honestly do believe we should move more away from ""I have x,y,z symptoms am I going to die?"" to ""How can I find peace of mind and stop googling"" 


One thing I do to get peace of mind is watch this episode of [Hey Arnold](https://www.wco.tv/hey-arnold-season-2-episode-5-monkey-business-2) which is my all time favourite show (it's only the first episode in the video provided called 'monkey business' btw), I won't ruin it for you all, but it's really funny and will hit home for all of us, it highlights how silly we can be sometimes when we think we have a really bad illness and start obsessing over symptoms.

"Ketamine Therapy So the other day I'm on the net and I see an ad for a ketamine clinic that promotes it for bipolar, but provided no information. I requested the science to support their claim, and sent it to a scientist to back up what I had read. Thid scientist was also part of the DC ketamine trials and helped analyze the information. We were of the same mind. Good in theory, but no real science to support their claims. With MDD and PTST sure, but bipolar is a different kind of beast. Anyways I get a call from the doc that runs the cliinic. We talk for about 15 minutes and I get all my questions answered. They claim an 80% success rate. That seem super high for me. Also insurance doesn't cover it so it would all be out of pocket. I am a prime candidate, but I'm not going to pay money to be a lab rat, especially if there's a 20% failure rate. I would mean regular maintenence doses and stopping meds, which scare me.

Even though I still have some AvPD traits that I’m still working on, my therapist says I certainly no longer meet the diagnosis of AvPD.

I’ve gone from being a textbook AvPD with such bad social anxiety I barely left the house an could barely order a cheeseburger.
All through school people called me “socially retarded” and my mom thought I was autistic.
To now being a very socially skilled, confident, outgoing person who makes friends easily.

I’m curious if people are interested in some kind of a write up about how I’ve recovered from my AvPD, what helped me, how long it can take etc?

I see a lot of people struggling and feeling hopeless on this board.
It breaks my heart when I see people truly believe that recovery is impossible (and spreading that false message). It is possible! It’s just really hard, uncomfortable, takes a lot of time and you have to really want it.

Thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of? I’m also open to suggestions of what else could help.

P.S. I feel vulnerable writing this post in fear that people will have an angry, skeptical reaction or think I’m being narcissistic.

"not sure about what to do with my life. For the past 4 years I've (18m) struggled with depression, I guess it started with the very turbulent divorce of my parents (a violent fuckfest) when I was 14yo in 2019, it was at that time that I started doing drugs such as mdma, lsd and cocaine, however I'd say my drug consumption really started as young as 12 given that I would abuse my adhd medication (ritalin) by snorting it.
Later down that year I had some pretty shitty moments with my mother (physical violence) as my father abandoned us to go live in another country for half the year, when he came back, they found out about my drug usage, which again ended up in physical abuse and the over infantilization of a 15 yo boy who never had any freedom or power in his life, my parents started walking me to school (it was 2 blocks away from home lmao), once they even punched me infront of my classmates and threatened some random boy about beating him up because they confused him with someone I smoked weed with.
At the end of that year they sent me to love with my grandma in another country.
There I was, all alone in a country that was foreign to me although I was born there, I had family of course, but I can't really be myself around my family, the year was 2020 and I was just starting classes again when the pandemic hit, it was at that point when I abandoned my studies for the first time, tbh I didn't suffer through covid because I lived with my cousin and we played videogames all day, but I ended up drinking a ton of alcohol in secret again, sniffing gas from the stove, stealing pills from my grandma, because I was desperate, life felt like it physically weighted on me,
I stopped eating because sadness did not allow me to, I started getting weaker and weaker untill 10onths later my mother picked me up and we returned to tje country I was raised in.
It did not get better for a long time.
My mother did not trust me at all and didn't allow me to go outside (I was 16 at the time), she even hid the keys from me.
As I realized that she would never trust me again I said fuck it and started smoking weed again, yadda yadda I start studying again and pass the year (yay), but still, I was a 17yo boy who isolated himself for 2 years and didn't talk irl to anyone that wasn't family, I developed a serious internet addiction due to it.
In 2022 stuff got slightly better, but not really, during summer break I met a girl (26yo) online, and we start talking, we like each other, the first time I left my house in years for something that wasn't school was to meet her, which I did, at the cemetery, I was 17.
Later in that year I get into an altercation with my mother and she beats me again and kicked me out of her house, after that I live with my father for a couple weeks before she decided to ask me to come back home again (she never said sorry), I get even more depressive to the point I abandon my studies again.
Then I become 18 years old, and this 26yo girl I talked about before asks to unvirgin me (to which I said yes), she invited me to her brother's bday party.
When everyone went to sleep, we were in bed together, I was sleepy and high, and she was drunk and coked tf up, we had a very awkward kiss, I then say that I forgot to bring condoms and she mounts me anyway before I could say anything.
After that shitty experience we become a couple, my first girlfriend ever yay.
Fuck it was a rollercoaster of shit, she was abusive, she offered me coke after I was clean for 3 years, she insulted me and said I was only useful for sex, she even slapped me a couple of times.
Why does everyone abuses me?
Now, 2023, I have my first job, but I still struggle with my weight, which makes me very self aware of how weak and small I am.. I feel ugly, I feel emasculated.
Now I have to study again and I just can't keep up with study and work (my work shift goes from 4am to 12pm, and my classes go from 6pm to 12am)
I just want to give up, I feel like I don't deserve anything, I just want to sleep and sleep and wake up when everything's allright.

"4 years ago I wasnt showering for months at a time, depressed, anxious and paranoid. At the time I was sober going on 18, 19 years. I was, and am on disability since 09' for schizoaffective bipolar type disorder. 

For the longest time, especially since sobriety, I've been overwhelmed with thinking. Space, time, behavior, tornadoes...whatever. 

But, since my life was an unmanaged train wreck I had no confidence in myself as having any quality. It seems that feeling good about yourself comes from a well managed life.   


My last job was as a janitor on the army base near by roughly 5 years ago. I couldnt handle the pressure. I was so dependant on others for everything I was asking if I was sweeping properly. Very bad mindset. A lady mentioned crying and it made me feel like crying. I didnt understand how that could be. It seemed like witchcraft, so to speak. That was my last day at my last job. It was my 4th attempt to go back to work since my disability badge acquisition! 

I've been in therapy for 16 or 17 years ago I got into therapy from a mental health episode. During that visit at the crisis stabilisation unit in Virginia (Fredricksburg) I met a man that changed my life. He went by the name Bose Uncle. He taught me a breathing exercise. 3 in 6 out. You breath in deep for 3 seconds roughly then out for 6 seconds. Also roughly. Dont try to be specific like me and do it exactly 3 and 6. 

On down the road, life and me under pressure and practicing my breathing because sufferage bleep blop bloop, pandemic. Overwhelming, unadulteraded pain in the brain from an anxiety I'd never expierenced before I saw a vision. It seemed to be the exact same thing that happened to Bill Wilson from AA. A wind blew through me. His words. My words on it are, I was no longer a bound up point in time and space holding on to the memories from the stimulation from the moment. I was free from the tension that came about from the fucking utter bullshit that exists. I let it go. The moment. I stopped holding and figuring. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was like my being afraid got wore out. I remember specifiaclly saying to myself at the height of my pain in a ridgid bodily posture laying in my recline, ""bullshit."" I calle dbullshit on my old beliefs. That old fire and brimstone god. Intstead I chose ""my concept"" of life as my God. My ideas are good to. Changed life.   


About six months later I nearly died from pancreatitis. When I got home from 6 days in the hospital I shared it on facebook. I received a good number of get well soon messages as expected. I did not get what I thought I would. People coming to visit, bringing me food...all that. I nearly fucking died. I know hundreds of people. What does that mean? My perception is fucked up, my beghhvior is fucked up, I need to change.   


I did not think that way at first. At first I thought, ""I fucking hate everyone."" For a while. 

Then 6 months later, I got diagnosed with autism. April 24th 2021.   


6 months later after learning to relax, I rested on my heels for the first time in my life. This began the second chapter of my life. The taking my time portion. The I am the most impotant person in my life to me. You all come second. For ever. I no longer run to the kitchen, the bathroom, through the grocery store, drive fast, or move my limbs fast. I have even taken control of my eyes speed of movement.   


Did you know that your body can control your mind. If you dont control your body your body will be controlled by your environment throught the mind.   


You receive stimulus simply due to being a sensing being. This moves you. If you are not aware of it. Make yourself aware of this and take control of your body, the way you look, smell, move (behavior speed) amplitude of voice ...total bodily control and you can eliminate a great deal of your own suffering. I havew come off my depression meds and greatfully have finally been more aptly medicated with litium. Now I dont have to force myself into slow mo behavior but I do stay aware I think from a bit of fear.   


You can control your thinking!   


You can control your thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I wish I could impress upon whomever needs it that the pause in conversation is ok. Moving the body oddly slow is not odd. Not speaking is an answer. And, you dont owe a motherfucker a goddamn thing if it stresses you out.

"Delusional neighborsHi everyone, I live in LA and my neighbors like to talk outside in the hall of the apartment complex. Btw I live in the projects (talking to them nicely is not going to be a solution.)Do not know much about them since they live across the hall. All I know is that there are adults (let us call them the red neighbors) in their thirties or older, do not work and I think they live off food stamps like a lot of people in the projects. There are a total of 5 women possibly not sure. Most of their time they spend talking outside their apartment door, hallway, or staircase. My apartment is less than 20 feet from the staircase so I guess they can hear when I am doing my chores. Lately, I noticed that they have been giving me stares when I see them outside. They used to talk to me before when I moved in years ago ""hi neighbor, how are you?"" when they would see me but shortly after that we stopped. No reason at all and well I do not mind because I have social anxiety so it is hard for me to speak to strangers even if they are my neighbors. So I might come off as shady to people but I am a no-one so why should someone care right? Anyways I also noticed that they have been talking ""quiter"" when I start cooking, or doing laundry, or washing my dishes but I feel like my neighbors think I am nosy and eavesdropping. They have not said anything to me directly but I have heard them say ""stop pretending your cooking"" or sometimes mentioning my apartment number. I am not sure if they were saying this subtle comment directly to me or whatnot but I am always listening to music with my earbuds on so maybe it is in my head.update: I wrote the top part a couple of days ago and left it as a draft bc I did not know what else to write but here is an update on this situation. they asked me when they found me in the lobby.

I am often hearing music on my earbuds when I do my chorers. but if you do not like people listening in to your daily convos then I suggest talking outside of the building or in your own apartment"" neighbors: ""I know you are fucking lying. if you continue to do this ill fuck you up!"" I was taken aback by this ""confrontation"" bc I am allowed to do my chores at any time of day. just bc they are out there talking does not mean I should stop and not do it at all until they leave. So I am a bit shaken up since I have anxiety I am getting very nervous. I do know that they were not bluffing when it came down to fighting me. like I mentioned I live in the projects and it is not the nicest place to live nor are people nice here. I can not move out since I have not finished school nor do I have a full-time job. Can anyone help me with how I should go about it??? I am freaking out. i live with other family members and I am scared they might harm them too. we are on the skinny and petite side while they are tall and big so we are at a disadvantage here. I just cannot wrap my head around the reason why they are mad at me. do they feel entitled and why? are they on drugs that it has damaged how they think? Or are other neighbors on my floor talking shit about me to them? I once heard another neighbor (orange neighbor) who I have never talked to but I know his voice since he likes to join them in the hallway. Well, he referred to me as the Spanish female and he kept on repeating my apartment number. To this day I have no idea why. I know this because he was yelling at this point. that another neighbor (pink neighbor) had to come out and calm him down (btw pink, orange, and red neighbors know each other. I think they grew up in the same building since they were children. Also, all the neighbors are thirty or beyond since they have kids) Another instance was that the red neighbors were fighting outside in the hall that pink neighbors stepped in and said to lower the volume bc ""Spanish girl"" is listening. Tf why would I be listening plus I am not the only person living on the floor there are other families and they are being loud enough for everyone to hear. Mind you I was nowhere doing chores but in my bedroom and they were loud enough for me to hear. I just do not get why they are picking on me and I am the Spanish girl since I am the only Spanish on my floor. Why would Pink neighbors say that? Could it be bc they hold a grudge against me? Before COVID pink neighbor's kids used to play in the hall and their kids intentionally would hit my door with a basketball and kick it while laughing. I confronted them and never apologized instead they acted as If I was the villain. Btw all of these neighbors also do not work is that why they are so interested in me since they have nothing else to do??? I start working soon in person again so hopefully, I do not run on them but that is probably a lie since they stay at home all the time. I just do not understand what is it about me that they feel like they could bully me. I have been bullied before so this brings back memories and makes me feel like shit.

"I feel like there is something fundamentally broken with me.*Everyone* told me that after high school I would feel better. I do not think I have ever felt worse in my entire life than I do right now. I have no passions, no aspirations, I do not like doing anything and I have no idea of what to study in university/college. But I *have to* because it is not like I can get myself a decent job if I start crying everytime someone looks at me in public. Between depression and social anxiety my will to live or do anything is pretty much negative. My parents keep yelling at me because finishing high school did not magically cure me. Honestly I hate existing, I hate existing with every single fiber of my being. I feel like shit everyday and people keep telling me to ""appreciate the small things"" as if thinking that a sunset is pretty for 3 seconds will make up for the fact that I have been crying myself to sleep for the past 2 years. fuck you.

I do not like anytthing actually, how can I keep living like this? And why? I am not suicidal but I think the only reason that I am still here is that I would feel guilty leaving my parents with the pain of losing their only daughter... and the fact that I am really afraid of death and what comes after.

"Sorry in advance for lengthy post. To start, my husband (41) &amp; I (40) have been together for about 25 years. I have gone through dark stages in my life. Suicidal thoughts + failed attempts. I used work as a coping method but I did not get anywhere with my work. still a manager while an account assistant I worked with 10+ years ago is now a Director. Due to unexpected post partum complication, I was hospitalized after giving birth. Hormone roller coaster. Zero visitors b/c of Covid. Finally was on antidepressant. I stopped them after hospital discharge. Fast forward to now, I start to feel that our marriage and feelings for each other has changed. I understand dynamics change with a baby but why do I always feel hes cheating? Sex life is nonexistent since pregnancy. We were both very excited and blessed with this child as conceiving was difficult. the happiest moment in our lives became the saddest at the same time. Enduring the pain of not being able to see my newborn meanwhile , He took care of our baby himself. Its as if we fought our own battles. It was not easy for both of us &amp; I thought it would only make us stronger. Yet why do I feel the opposite?I have had similar episodes before where I feel our marriage is failing &amp; all I wanted was to leave this world. I have started having same sad feelings. Sensitivity level is high. quickly boils down to a failed relationship. he has not been sleeping well the past few days. The other day he suddenly woke up and went for his morning walk with the dog. Typically, wed go together. I called him as I could not see him at the park. Finally he came back and I asked him where he was &amp; that I called him five times. He pulled out his phone &amp; said he had it on silent somehow. I do not know why my first instinct was that he met up with someone. Maybe because his walk was much longer than usual? I know hes been bothered by work lately but my first thought his insomnia was possibly because this other woman is pregnant or something(?)Yesterday was tough. I was sick to my stomach with the feeling hes definitely seeing someone. I was quite certain hell leave us. That He has already forgotten about our baby, our love, our excitement when we first learned of the news. Thoughts came rushing in. Sadness swelled up my body. I had thoughts of leaving, I craved alcohol and had a few sips. The feeling of leaving this world was strong. The emptiness. The feeling that you have lost everything.

"Here we go again: EMDR Take 2 I have PTSD as the result of an extensive history of sexual abuse. My therapist guided me through 9 months of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) in 2016. It was BRUTAL, but my symptoms were nearly nonexistent after we finished it up. I recently have had some symptoms pop back up, and after an assessment it appears that I’m in need of a “tune up” as my therapist calls it. So here we go again... I’m starting it again today. I hope that it’ll be a little less sucky since I’ve put some hard work into it previously and that it’ll be short-lived compared to 9 months of nonstop weekly EMDR sessions. I’m still EXTREMELY anxious as I get closer and closer to my appointment today because I know that things will get worse before they get better.

Has anyone been through EMDR before? Do you have any coping skills that help you, especially in between sessions when your brain is processing everything? 

PS: For the record, I’m not trying to scare anyone who is facing the possibility of going through this process. Doing EMDR has changed my life for the better. I’ve had PTSD as long as I can remember, and the relief that it’s brought me has been amazing. Just stick it out until it gets better.

I know lifes not fair. But I have been in therapy my entire life and the whole basis is basically loving ourselves and re raising ourselves. Giving ourselves what we have never got. I hate having to work every second of my life having to give love all day and do all the work of my childhood and beyond. Why was I cursed with this life. Its non stop work and its hell. I hate being here. Why do I have to spend the rest of my days doing the work my caregivers and parents should have But NO I have to waste my youth and adult years journaling every fucking day and exercising every day just to combat this.

"Hi all, in my short 19 years on this earth I have been through many trials and triumphs but my life seems to be getting progressively worse and I have not had the best life I ever and already feel like I have lived a lifetime worth of experiences due to the trauma I have experienced in my life like: sexual, emotional, physical abuse, stabbed someone when I was 17 and attacked them with mallet due to bullying, being involved with a police chase, surviving car accident, being a addict and addicted to alcohol at age 17 until last (year age 19),being deaf in left ear from birth, survived surgery, survived many illness and infection as a young child, and being revived at birth due to oxygen loss, severe bullying, I have had around 50-60 suicidal episodes last year and have had many more prior. I managed to obtain my NCEA Lvl 1,2,3 even though I was kicked out of school due to being sevely bullied and having everyone hate me, I have had many fun sexual experiences, done some pretty crazy and one of a kind stuff, seen and done things alot of people could ever do etc. I always made sure to live every day as if it was my last and live fearless so I have lived my life on the edge and to the fullest although I was lonely and sad alot of it due to anxiety and past trauma. But things were starting to look up around last year I acquired a good job and a wonderful partner S.C. ironically I had my car accident 15mins after I dropped her off at a friend's place as she stayed at mine and we had only met in person the night before. But our relationship prospered and that crash made me become clean from alcohol and drugs because of the thought of her and prospect of career and family I have always wanted to raise children and live on a farm in the countryside etc. But... My life has changed for the worst now=Initially my illness started about 1am on Jan 18th 2021 after I awoke from a vivid nightmare drenched in sweat then I had an auditory hallucination and diahorrea and vertigo and derealization/confusion and brainfog and was shivering with chills but after I went back to sleep it went away within 1-day and in between time I went on holiday and suffered vertigo and ear pain on the car ride down and the initial sickness did not appear until Feb 9th I got the bad flu w/sore throat, vertigo, ear pain, coughing, running nose, chills, diahorrea etc. And on Feb 13th I then suffered derealization, severe brainfog, crying and sadness and anxiety, REM sleep issues like: falling sensation that jolts awake, flashing behind eyelids, hypnogogic hallucination, constant vivid nightmares every night, head pressure, diahorrea, excessive urination and short-term memory loss and a bunch of other stuff then around early March came a psychotic ocd presentation where I had this delusion I was developing shitzophrenia and had an intense fear of it and constantly Googled it then that sort of stopped and the derealization died down a bit and I was left with andeonia complete loss of emotions and then severe depression and mood swings the came these mini-stroke/seizures and severe brainfog that happened around start of last month and every time I had them I was getting memory-loss after long term and short-term almost dementia like memory loss then I developed an internal vibration. So currently of now my symptoms are: a slight brainfog, internal vibration, dementia memory-loss, vivid nightmares: still having hypnogogic hallucination upon waking, minor head pressure, crying and sadness/severe depression, and complete loss of emotional enjoyment in life, loss of track of time and what is going on around me, inability to retain information, loss of imagination, hair thinning, easily bruising, loss of libido, abdomen pain. So as of now I am 5.5 months into this illness and shts only getting worse I have had many blood tests, tried different diets, meds help with mood but none of the other symptoms, tried therapy, had 2 CT scans of head w/o Contrast tried heaps nothing works. I personally think it is maybe autoimmune encephalitis due to a virus, covid maybe? Not sure. So yeah I am pre much F'ed atm. Me and my girlfriend do long distance and she has stuck by me all through this, she flys up to where I live today as her family lives here and she comes up every school holidays I love her so much and she says she loves and supports me and will do till death and we are keeping each other alive as she struggles with her own issues too but I just feel useless and dead. An example is my nana she is in a dementia home and you look into her eyes and the life is just gone... No soul, just a lost mind trapped within a body that imprisons her that is how I feel atm and I do not want this to go on forever as I cannot feel life and emotions and feel severaly disconnected from everything and have impaired cognitive function as well as experiencing symptoms on the daily. I have always had a different insight on life I feel and have always thought and felt different from others idk why but I just have I feel special in this world and sometimes I wonder if it is just me alive and everyone else is figure of imagination idek haha. My plan is too spend my last 2-weeks with her and then if I feel no better or see no reason to continue then I will end it. Sorry for all the words and wall of text you prolly do not need my life story but I want to make sure my story is read by atleast someone before I go.As many of you know its a dog eat dog world and weakness is not tolerated and only the strongest survive unfortunately I am no longer strong and just a she will of a man really so yeah I was crying afraid of death and asking why this has happened to me for ages every night alone but I now realise maybe the good go first so we do not experience as much suffering as the bad who live on and generally die alone. The world is a strange place atm and is just full of pain, narcassism, suffering, corruption.

"I think about suicide every day. It has been like this for many years now.I am now 50 and have spent most of my life working where it has been the main focus of my life. I had success but most of the money went to investors (founded a company that sold for $27M). Have been working on another startup for 8 years and making minimal income and living off savings. Doing it all myself as I do not trust people anymore. Been through a divorce caused by this and was in a marriage that meant I could not properly run my new startup for most of that time. Ex took half my assets and I am sure was putting a lot extra away for years.It is ridiculously hard. I have a product as good as anything in the market and comparable to other products raising 10's of millions of dollars. But I cannot get it out there, nothing I do works enough. I now have a product that probably requires a team of developers and I am maintaining it all myself and trying to grow the business.I am just so tired, burnt out and depressed I cannot do the things I need to do to make this work anymore and I feel I am going to lose everything.The only thing keeping me going is the thought that I have the product and the hope that one day I will get noticed or will be able to get my marketing sorted and get in front of the right customers.I feel I am going backwards and everyone I know seems to be going forward on easy mode. Home are going up in value (we sold our beautiful big house in the divorce and now renting), well paying jobs with minimal effort (IT).I just spent my entire weekend working and doubt it will make a dent while other people are enjoying their lives.I will never find a partner again as I am financially ruining myself.I just want to end it all but my 10 year old daughter still needs me. It would devastate her if I was gone. For the last few years I have just been thinking try to last as long as you can until she does not need you as much (maybe 16). I am not living for any future now, I do not look forward to anything. Every day I wake up and say to myself 'I want to die'.She is still full of hope and tells me about her dream house and dream bedroom etc and says things like ""daddy when your website gets better do you think we could get a new house etc"".

"Back story how I got to where I am. I am 20F and I moved in with my boyfriend a few months ago. Everything was going great until I got depressed again. I could take care of myself properly, could not get myself motivated to do anything, slept in later than I should. And my bf tried to help me in a way I told him time and time again that it would not work. For some reason everytime someone in my life pushes me to do things that I am scared of or have a hard time doing, I just shut down completely. I agree I was pretty terrible to live with. Some days I helped out so much around the house and other days I could not get myself to do anything at all. I also did not have a job because he would not jump start my car because he was so afraid of me crashing my car on purpose (I would not do that). Flash forward to three weeks ago: everything got worse, we started fighting constantly. He told me I should have tried harder and he was right. He said it was killing him to see me like this. He said if I did not get myself fixed or start doing more for myself that hell kick me out. So I slowly started to do more and take care of myself. However, we still fought constantly. I still could not get him to realize how I felt the way I do and could not get him to start my car. So with that being said I still could not get a job and he hated that. Flash forwarded again, last night he packed up all of my things and kicked me out. The entire time telling me he felt so bad for doing this but it all my fault. Then he got moody and told me that until I get better that we can only be friends. So I was crying hysterically and could not drive myself back to my parents so, he had to take me home. I had a bad panic attack to the point I could not breathe and my whole body was all locked up joint wise. Took him a bit to realized that I was not just trying to get him to let me stay and I needed help with it. He told me if I start making progress with myself that we can start seeing eachother again but I feel lost. My parents are so mad at me because I failed my relationship. They because very strict with me and are pushing me the exact way I told them it would not help. there is more but this is the just of what happened.

"Overwhelmed, tired, scared I’m typing this after realizing the amount of mistakes I made these past few weeks at work. It’s been so hard to focus and I’m finding that I can’t understand basic (so they seem) task requirements.
Desk job, working with numbers and reports, Maths have never been my forte, I’m surprised even to this very day how I’ve been hired and still work here after many years. I feel like I’m always behind everyone else and I can’t use logic when looking at numbers. 
Well this time the mistake I made was because I/we haven’t checked some figures, I didn’t get help (my manager is on holidays, other members of the team are busy with their stuff), I didn’t connect the dots.
I just can’t do it anymore. I live under constant pressure due to work, so many sleepless nights, thoughts racing in my head, stupid scenarios I build, poor nutrition and so many times of crying uncontrollably.
I don’t want to blame external factors but there has been constant miscommunication which also led to where we’re at. 
My therapist can only help so much, I always feel great after each session and it looks like have the right tools and mindset to get better, but inherently I’m always on the edge, stressed and scared of consequences.

Tried using free therapy but cops showed up to house to take me to ER after telling Dr over phone that idealizition was getting to point I was having visions of doing it and waking up confused when I was still at my computer desk. Overheard nephew telling people all I do is sleep and that he does not like that I lived with him. Dad stopped having genuine conversations with me after talking to the cops. Last thing he said was I should not put him through lossing a son. Now when I talk to him it seems like he is annoyed or wants me to figure out how to be happy.

It all started with me having a tight throat feeling which I have because of GERD (I didn’t know at that time), and I searched it up on google and all my symptoms matched thyroid cancer, etc. I got panic attacks, laying in bed for hours searching on google at age 13.  It became so bad that I never went outside. I used to either tell my friends I’m sick, or just talk to them over the phone to something. 2014 is when I developed my first real disease, called Visual Snow, symptoms are where you are tiny dots over your vision, like pixels. Luckily I’ve managed to ignore that and accepted it as a part of me. 

At age 16 I dropped out of high school because I was unable to wake up in the morning and get ready. Since I dropped out of high school I developed BDD (Body Dysmorphia). It became so bad that I never went out in daylight. I checked the mirrors every 30 minutes, hated my face, etc.  Now I’m 18 and have noticed 4 months ago that my tongue twitches in the mirror (fasciculations).

could not really find the perfect title its more about the process of finding someone which I would consider dating and I was wondering if someone here felt the same or experienced the same and might give me some advice.So I had this happen a few times in the last year where I get to know someone and it feels like I am completely falling in love with the other person even tho I barely know them just because it feels nice being around them. But it really hit me a week ago. I met this girl at a party and we had a one night stand sorta. We could not sleep alot so we just layed next to each other talked and kissed for like 6 hours till 11am.I have not felt better in the last year. I just felt safe being with her. When I woke up that night I did not think about how I wanted to sleep again or how I would just like to kill myself my mind was at rest atleast for a while.do not get me wrong I liked that girl but I barely know her and she is probably not even really my type but I still feel like I would do anything for her or for being with her again and more often. Its not rational but this happens so often although this time the feeling is so much stronger. I feel like I am being so heavily influence by the fact that I am not feeling good at all. This makes things like that so much stronger and I cannot think rational. I cannot distinguish between the feeling of me actually being into someone or just being into the feeling I get when I am around them. And you could probaly change that girl with any other random one and Id feel the same for just that person.

"Thanks for being the community I never dreamt to have  

so yesterday I had a therapy session, and the therapist asked why i think  i have no friends.

i answered i have interests that few share, where i live as i live in a small city, so it is hard to have friends or form relations based on interests. also, i have no interest in sports and that is the common interest where i live 

i told him i am part of many online communities, but i just lurk as i feel that i don't belong enough to participate in  these communities even if they are based on my interests

at that moment i remembered reddit and this community, and i felt that i already have a community where i can freely be who i am without  fear

When I joined reddit it was for something tech related, then i said why not searching for avoidant and i was expecting nothing but to my surprise i found this sub, and it was unbelievable as it is hard to find anything related to avoidant

i was new to reddit and navigating it, but i was happy as i found people like me.

as i kept browsing, i started to get related more and more to your posts. I felt a connection to you,  and i realized i am not alone anymore.

Knowing i am not alone anymore, is one of the greatest things anyone can ask for, it meant i have People who can understand me and my struggle and what i am going through.

People who can understand me and i can understand them.

People with who i can share whatever i want, knowing they will understand me and won't judge me 

in this community,i don't hesitate or feel shy to share anything with you

from sharing memes to asking questions and seeking help and advice

here, I share my problems and secrets that no one knows, including my family.

I finally found a home here and family 

this community really seems like an oasis in the desert 

I have more to say about this community but i want to keep this post short as possible.

i feel blessed that i found you and being part of this community 

i just wish I could meet you or some of you in the real world

and to newcomers welcome abroad. in one way or another, you aren't alone anymore.",Personality disorder,"{""category"": ""Personality Disorder""}",2025-04-21 05:15:45.334292,e5-large-v2

I thought that I would feel better with that whole college thing behind me but nos it just feels worse because I feel like I wasted 4 years and thousands in student loans for nothing. I do not feel motivated by anything anymore, and nothing really improved. I lost all my passion and all I do is letting myself rot in my bed all day. My family mostly thinks about how much they wasted by helping me paying off my college fees instead caring for my personal career opportunities and I just feel like everyone is letting me down since I am one of the few who failed. I have no more will to do anything nor to see anyone, and I even keep avoiding my roomate so I do not have any kind of human interaction because I am just a big ball of angst and do not want to project it on anyone (also because people are just a pain in the ass tbh).Now the ""best summer of my life"" is beginning by me feeling guilt and angst because of college and all my plans getting aborted because of sudden financial issues and me leaving the only small trip that made me feel a bit less stressed out because of health issues (and more fees yay).I do not really know how to feel motivated to do anything again and I just cannot get over that angst and disappointment feeling.

"Paranoia and Anxiety about that Brain Eating Amoeba Hi everyone. I'm pretty new to this sub, but I really need to vent.

 I was diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder two years ago and I generally have a pretty good hold of it. Yesterday, I was showering and a drop or two or water got into one nostril in my nose. I could feel it chilling in my nose hair and I immediately used my towel to wipe it out and then I blew my nose when I got out of the shower. However, I live in Florida, and I'm really paranoid that the brain eating amoeba is lurking in the water. This was water from the shower head in my dorm and it has been colder lately, but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I'm terrified; I'm even tearing up with fear writing this. My birthday is next week and I want to be okay for that and for everything. My mom said I'm worrying needlessly and she's probably right but I can't shake the anxiety.

Edit to add: It doesn't help that symptoms apparently don't develop for 1-9 days after infection, so I'm going to be sitting in my anxiety for days.",Anxiety,"{""category"": ""Anxiety""}",2025-04-21 05:16:59.239082,e5-large-v2

"Paxil withdrawal induced hypomania/rapid cycle I f**ed up my life in just 2 weeks.

My brief history:

* fall 2014 was prescribed Paxil 20mg/day for mild depression, anxiety and hypochondria. 
* Tapered from 20mg to 10mg in 6 month.
* I was on 10mg since June 2015 till August 2017. So: 2 years, 10mg daily. I always took medicine before go sleep.
* I tapered from 10mg/day to 2.5mg/day in 5-7 months (August 2017 ~ March 2018)
* I stopped to take medication 2 weeks ago (20 of March).

Until this point I was TOTALLY FINE. 

Now detailed description of last 2 weeks:

* First 5 days were totally fine
* On day 6 (30 MArch) first withdrawals symptoms kicked in: shivering, cold, severe insomnia
* On day 12 (1 April) withdrawals was unbearable, experience first manic/depressive episode. Decided to reinstate on 5mg(and later 10mg)/day. I took my first half pill midday.
* Day 13 (2 April): 5mg morning, 5mg evening
* Day 14 (3 April): 5mg morning, 0mg evening
* Day 15 (4 April): 5mg morning, 5mg evening
* Day 16 (today, 5 April): 5 mg morning

The symptoms I have now are rather painful and hardly bearable. Most prominent are: RAPID cycling from depressive episodes(+moredate agitation and anxiety) to hypomanic episodes and severe insomnia. Cycles changing every few hours and quite intensive! I never had this before, never!! Now I'm totally off, confused, suicidal, haven't slept cople nights. I'm in  hypomanic episode right now so I can write this post. I took sick leave at my work, but if this will continue I will lose my job completely. I beg you for advice on how I can stabilize now, based on what I've already done. I'm not even looking to weaning off meds now, as there are a lot of life circumstances now that I responsible for. I just want to stabilize and reduce pain.
What I can do at this point? It's do hard to believe I broke my brain beyond repair so rapidly, just in 2 weeks. I was normal, happy and fully of life. Now I'm anxious, agitated and depress vegetable, lying on the coach wanting to die/suicide.
Any advice highly appreciated.

P.S. yes, I visited my GP,  he put me on a waiting list to mental illness clinic (waiting time ~4 weeks) and advised to continue Paroxetine 10mg/day for 2 weeks and then increase to 20mg/day if needed.

I wen't to the eye doctor and he told me that i had PVD or occular migraine. He also told me that my right pupil was smaller then the left one so he called some neurologist and he did some tests but there was nothing wrong with them. But right now im starting to belive that he was wrong and that i have some super rare eye disease or maybe a brain tumor.

"Vitamin D and B-12 Deficiency Sorry about lack of clarity, I’m not exactly sure how to phrase this because I’m confused myself, and I am on mobile.

I sought out treatment after I was having some pretty concerning suicidal thoughts the past year.

I reached out the a therapist at my University, and immediately was referred to a psychiatrist under the guise of maybe benefitting from mood stabilizers.

Before my psychiatry appointment, I researched into mood stabilizers and saw they were used in treating bipolar. Read up on bipolar and really identified/ understood why she would recommend me to the psychiatrist assuming she thought I could have bipolar. 

Met with the psychiatrist, and not to my surprise she said she was sure I was bipolar. However she wanted me to get bloodwork before starting me on lithium to see my levels in various things. She said she was going to diagnose me official with unspecified mood disorder until she saw my results regarding my thyroid. 

I was pretty bummed hearing this news, she essentially told me I had bipolar disorder but lacked whether it was I or II, so I still felt lost but like I was on the right track.

Well, my blood work came back and everything was normal except I had extremely low vitamin D and B-12. My psychiatrist called me and gave me dosage for otc vitamins. I read into the situation wrong and assumed she was just reducing my issues down to deficiencies.

I know these two deficiencies do not explain mania. Maybe vitamin D explains psychosis, but I don’t experience this. I felt like everyone was so sure I was bipolar and led me on to thinking I had a solution, and I think this issue runs deeper than just supplements.

I know many mental illnesses have links to vitamin deficiencies, and I guess my confusion comes from whether or not anyone else experienced this along with being bipolar. I have an appointment on Thursday, first one since bloodwork, and was wondering if I should mention the bipolar diagnosis if she doesn’t.

TLDR; is my doctor reducing her diagnosis to needing vitamin d and b-12? Can this and bipolar coincide? ",Bipolar,"{""category"": ""Bipolar""}",2025-04-21 05:18:07.372305,e5-large-v2

"How being outside reduces stress I will explain why being outside is good for your health. Nowadays we are often indoors almost all day because of school and work. There’s not always something wrong with that, but you’ll probably feel a lot better if you go outside every now and then.

**IT MAKES THE MIND CLEARER**

Inside a house, study or workplace there are often many things that make you think about your work or study. There is nothing wrong with this, but it can ensure that you are constantly busy with your work or study. This may keep you thinking and living in your head instead of in the moment. In addition, there are all kinds of other distractions indoors that keep your mind from calming down. So go outside and enjoy the tranquility.

**LESS STRESS**

This tranquility automatically reduces stress. You are not busy with school, your work, or other things. As a result, you go out of your head and into the moment. This will also reduce your stress and reduce the risk of stress symptoms and complaints. In addition, physical exercise is also a great way to reduce stress. When you are physically active you can reduce stress. You probably also feel that when you exercise. And after you exercise you notice that your stress is reduced compared to before you started exercising.

"I have been struggling with depression since my mid/late teens. I am in college now; and I thought Id be better once I moved away from my family( toxic). However I think I might have actually gotten worse. All the stress for deadlines, rent, if I have enough money for food, if I can afford medicine for my cold, it just keeps building up. I am not sure if I want to handle the stress of being an adult. I cannot help but imagine running away and disappearing from the world. Devolving into my self and then into the water and ceasing to exist. It sounds so much easier than life. I took on a computer science degree durring the pandemic. I wanted to learn a new profitable skill so I could eventually support myself with a secure and I demand job. However online college, its not how my brain learns. From distanced learning; I cannot process and if the information, and if I took the time to relearn every lesson from a tutor ( I learn best being taught in person) then I would not have the time to earn money and study, or the means to eat a proper meal. And if I finished my freshman year of college not retaining any information; I feel like I am screwed for the next year. If I have spent so much money and time just to show no improvement; why am I even here. I want to drop out if college. But then Id have to work a minimum wage or lower job and try to support myself and still deal with the stress of being an adult.

If it continues then I start to see peoples dead body hanging from them. Just out of the corner of my eye, then Ill turn to look. And there is nothing there.I do not think I even check if its real anymore. Its just become the shadow of people in the corner of my eye , swinging slightly with the wind.

I felt regret for leaving my loved ones behind. I did not have enough strength to call 911, so I just blacked out praying because I still wanted to live. Miracles happen, and me being able to write this is one of them.I did not die. I cannot explain how. I drank 100 pills, did not go to the hospital, and somehow managed to survive.Today, one of my friends called me. She even invited me to a trip.I thought I was alone. I thought no one cared about me. It turned out to be false. People care. I only had to wait 2 days more.If I had died on Monday, I would have died believing a lie. I would have died thinking that my life was doomed.

"Lumps on neck and head now. Okay so first of all thank you for reading this, I am struggling with bad anxiety right now. 

I have had two lumps on the side of my neck for 2 years now and have been told in the past by a doctor that they were nothing. I was put on antibiotics (which didn't seem to help) and sent away. I recently had them checked out again and the doctor ordered an ultrasound (which I have yet to go to) to make sure they weren't cancer. I have zero symptoms otherwise.

 Fast forward to now I have a larger lump on the back left side of my scalp. I'm trying to tell myself it's just a cyst but the anxious pattern seeking side of me is having a hard time time letting it go.  It's larger than the other two and is  hard and hurts a little when I apply pressure. 

There are a few causes I can think of 

1. It's just a cyst, and completely unrelated to my other two swollen lymph nodes. My fathet has a history of cysts, which may account for mine.

2. I'm pretty sure I remember hitting my head on something about a week ago, so it could just be a bruise of sorts. (memory isn't clear)

3. Cancer. I'm gonna die, hit the panic button, ect...

4. I recently have been having allergies or a cold which could be due to an infection which could be making my lymph nodes react. 


This is the way my anxious mind sees it: I must have cancer because there is now a third lump to add on the other two I've had for years. I've left it untreated for so long that I'm scared to even go to a doctor. Now it must be spreading to my brain which would probably make it inoperable. I will get brain cancer and die at 19 due to my lack of action.

I'm honestly having trouble deciphering hypochondria from reality.

I'm hoping someone besides myself could make a determination as to whether or not I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thank you.

"Hi all, first time here hope you guys are doing well. To start, I can tell you that being a 5 foot tall male living here in America is worse than death. Everyone treats me like absolute shit, from strangers, friends, family, and of course women. it is already challenging making friends, dating life is on a whole other level of difficulty. I have had countless instances from strangers to even family giving me dirty looks, treating me unfairly solely for my height. I have followed the advice of what short males should do, such as working on yourself by improving looks, earning money, confidence, personality, etc. I have done all that, I am an attractive guy, I have money, and I am muscular for my size. I workout and I am 160lbs at 18% bodyweight, which is huge for my size. Despite all these positives that everyone says you should focus on, it has not changed a thing as far as dating life. There has been two instances in which I have been told the exact quote ""I would date you if you were taller"" by my crushes, once in high school and the other recently in college, and these events destroyed me. I do not get any attention from women even though I have all these attributes. I cannot really blame them because they can probably find someone else who has exactly all the same qualities as me, only that they are taller so why the fuck would they go for me? I am nothing special. I am currently 20, studying a passion that I love at a good university, and I have a family that cares for me. Those are the only reasons I have not offed myself yet. My parents have used so much of their time and money putting into my education and life, and I know if I kill myself my entire family's life will be ruined forever. And my depression/suicidal thoughts are completely hidden from them because I am too embarrassed to tell them or anyone else for the matter. it is just not an option, I am sorry. Reflecting on my current life, I literally have no friends. Barely had any success dating wise. These past years have made me turn into a person that I never thought I would become. I began hating everyone I see, especially if they were taller because I keep questioning why life fucked me over for my height while everyone else gets to enjoy theirs normally. And I am sorry if you think this is not a reason for suicide, but to me it is been the biggest problem of my life that I just cannot handle any longer. I really do not know how much longer I can tolerate this. I fear that I will never get to live a normal life as everyone else from enjoying time with friends to being loved romantically with a partner, so why would I waste anytime and just end it all now?

"Battling with intrusive thoughts Tw: (thoughts of) self harm, drug abuse, suicidal thoughts 
(m/22, if you care)


First things first, I really need to vent right now and dont know if anyone is even gonna read that but I just need to get this out of my head.
And sorry, if my english isn't good...

So, I've been battling depression for over a decade, I've mostly gotten better after years of therapy and carefully choosing the people around me so I've been pretty stable for a few years with less and less backlashes.

Today marks the first day after about 3 years where I'm getting extremely intense thoughts about self harming, drug abuse and even suicidal thoughts.

I've already been in a pretty bad mood today, overthinking a lot and shit like that and I had to go to social event I didn't really wanna take part in but usually it turns out better than expected. It wasn't like that today. I've felt even worse and useless (despite my friends trying to cheer me up) and realized that I'm not good at anything. I tried to drink those thoughts away with some cocktails (which usually works wonders for me in social events) but that just made it worse.
Since I got home I've just been sitting on my bed and staring at the wall, my thoughts going through a downward spiral. I drank some more and feel better and worse at the same time. I've even got to the point that I noticed another issue I haven't even realized before but makes so much sense comparing it to the events in my life. Then I thought of numbing my pain with a method I used years ago, forced myself not to because the scars have almost faded out. Then I thought about what drugs I could use to distract my mind, even started to research before I stopped myself and decided to rant here.
I'm very aware of my thoughts which makes me instantly feel regretful and even more like a shitty person.

"Terrified of brain amoeba / fowleri Hi everyone. I'm down in South Australia, and I've found myself going a little insane over something very silly for the last day....

I will start by saying that our water has a decent amount of chlorine as far as I can tell, it's the only thing you can taste in the water, and if you fill a bathtub it's even ever so slightly green. There's never been an order to boil water or anything of the sort either here.

So moving onto story time. I often get itchy eyes before bed, so I keep a glass of water in the bathroom, that way I can rinse my eyes out quickly to calm things down, the glass of water had probably been out for a few hours, anywhere from 6- 12. Last night I did it, and as the water ran down my face a little bit got in my nose, maybe a drop or 2 tops. I started freaking a minute later as I remembered all I'd read about fowleri.... I blew my nose a bunch, and I rolled up some toilet paper, and stuck it up my nostril as well in an attempt to deal with any water that had made its way up there. I spent a terrified hour in bed reading things on my phone, and eventually calmed down enough to sleep.

Now all day today I haven't had a fever or anything of the sort, but I have been getting sinus headaches. (Quite possibly from blowing my nose so much) And I got rather paranoid in the shower too, anytime water got near my nose, or even the tiniest bit might have entered I freaked out a bit. My right nostril which is the one the water entered is also worse than the left, but the discomfort might just be from me freaking out and blowing it a ton... I have bad sinuses at the best of times, so it could just be dust or allergies too.

I know I'm probably being silly, but some confirmation would be lovely, especially since the glass of water, while cold was sitting out a long time... A day of sinus headaches just doesn't exactly fill me with confidence, even if it probably was cause I wouldn't leave things alone. One last thing to note is that 2 family members of mine recently had colds, so that might be why I'm feeling crappy sinus wise too, the right side being worse than the left still has me all freaked out though.",Anxiety,"{""category"": ""Anxiety""}",2025-04-21 05:27:28.666256,e5-large-v2

I want to kms as a means of avoidance. I am too tired for life and I am tired of having to run away from my own mind at 100 mph. I probably have ocd and my stupid meds do not fucking work I hate it they made me jittery like a shot of adrenaline and cloudy at the same time so I stopped taking them. That were my last hope. Its just kind of sad knowing that some people just get the short end of the stick and there is nothing you can do about it. And even sadder knowing that I am one of those people. I got a shit life and a shit brain that nobody understands. It all just makes life seem kind of empty and pointless. I am SO TIRED OF LIVING ON THE OUTSIDE OF MY BODY I cannot fucking do this anymore. It hurts even more having to see my moms face everyday finally happy and stable unknowing that I am going to put a bullet in my brain soon.

"Just had a fun night with friends. I had alot of fun and we drunk and hung out for hours. Now I am home, sad, lonely, and feel like a burden to everyone. I have always struggled with silence (I hate it and have to fill it) and I definitely talk too much and over insist on sharing my opinions.here is the thoughts I jotted down before making this post:I talk too muchI share too muchI push my opinionsI do not accept social ques (to shut up) I always NEED to air my realizations/observations I am not confident in my opinions I am not confident in my social skills When I get home, alone, and analyze my behaviour I want to die (kill myself) I feel like everyone tolerates me and would be happier if I was deadI imagine them upset if I died and either feel validated by their sadness or... pained by how relieved they would be to have me gone. Anyone else feel this way? I do not know what to do. I desperately need to socialize and miss my friends when I do not see them. But everytime I socialize with my friends I go home to these feelings. It almost feels worst than sitting at home doi g nothing, alone and with no one. I do not know how to keep going on like this. I do not want to be alone... But these feelings scare the fuck out of me and I literally want to die to make them stop... I am at a loss and do not know how to keep going on like this.I love my friends. they have never indicated that I annoy them (but I feel as if I KNOW I do) I am ADHD and absolutely cannot stop myself from talking as soon as I let me guard down.

"For context, due to trauma and mental illness, I have been unable to work for about six months.I am these six months I have found society really does not give a fuck about your mental stability and comfort if you cannot work. Care is difficult to access, you are constantly at risk of homelessness, it is difficult to get on disability and you are discouraged to even do so for the fact the SSI system is clearly broken and pays so little.Every single thing I have used to bring myself comfort costs more money than I can currently comprehend having as I am facing years of therapy and little to no income.A non shattered phone screen from a phone I repeatedly drop due to anxiety shakes and dissociative episodes? cannot afford it.Open up your laptop to write up some of your thoughts just go get them out? Your Microsoft office subscription has expired, because everything needs to be a continuing revenue stream to milk you dry.Want to watch Netflix? YouTube without ads that remind you about what you cannot afford and send you into a spiral? New shoes because you have one pair and it is been falling apart for the past year? Reup to your laser hair removal so you can look at yourself in the mirror crying. A new pair of underwear because you are somehow down to just three? Everything is too fucking expensive. And when you literally are taking no money in and facing not taking any money in for the foreseeable future, every single purchase seems like too much.

"How do you even begin to explain your depression? I am hurting and I feel super alone. I have people around me and I am sure they will listen, but to what extent? I have ended up here because I feel like I am imploding and just want someone to hear me and know what I feel. I am a wife and a mother of one. My marriage is happy and my son is amazing, but I cannot get away from my depression and anxiety. I have had a bounty of traumatic experiences growing up, but who has not? I truly try to live for each day and leave the past where it belongs. I am extremely self-aware. I understand my mental illness. I am a very analytical person. I think that because of this, it makes my mental health worse. I want to fix myself, but I do not know how. I have extreme fears of being alone. I am terrified my husband will eventually decide to leave me because I am such a disaster (though he has shown no intention of this at all). Who wants to be married to a crazy person, right? I have never been in a relationship that was not emotionally abusive until I married my husband. Both of my parents were drug addicts and I was raised by my grandparents (who are incredible by the way). My biological mother (who was physically and emotionally abusive) is still a piece of work (putting it nicely). It took years, but my dad recovered and I do love him very much even though he still has some issues I am still uncomfortable with. In spite of that I have become a successful person. I swore Id never ever let my children see a moment of what I did as a child, and I have not, but I am still here feeling like a failure. I feel worthless. My insecurity is disgusting and my fears are eating me alive. I guess it does not help that I have barely any friends and now that I am working from home I am basically left to my own torment, every day. I used to have loads of friends when I lived in another city, but once I became pregnant I decided I needed to be closer to family. I did not move back home, just near. So I moved to a small town where I know no one. After starting my job once I moved. I have begun to have friends again, but none of them I feel close enough to be able to really open up. Honestly they are probably very open to listening, but I am still here terrified of judgment and causing what little friends I do have to go running for the hills.

"Pulsatile tinnitus So over the last week or so I've noticed that for about 10-15 seconds each day, I've heard a pulsing sound in my ear that sounds like a fan whirring. At first I thought it was an external sound, but then I pinned it down to coming from inside my head when I was in the bathroom one time. I googled it and it came up with pulsatile tinnitus, and it said the cause could be tumours, aneurysms, high blood pressure, hearing loss etc. 

I hear it in my right ear, and as I said it's normally for around 10 seconds a day at random times. I've been unable to trigger it or find a way to induce it; there seems to be no pattern to it. Which is odd because people who mention this talk of it being constant.  

I exercise regularly and do cardio, and I'm cutting down on my caffeine consumption to see if that helps. I've heard this can be a symptom of anxiety or can just be heightened awareness of my own body, which makes sense but don't exactly know what that means. You'd think I'd have noticed this before.

"My Goodbye NoteI am tired, I do not even know where to start, but I am tired. Ever since I was little, my dream has been studying and becoming a professional in a career I can be proud of. I was the type to take college classes in high school so I could expedite the process. When I got the opportunity to move the USA at the age of 15, of course I said yes. Yes, dad! Of course I want to go. The land of opportunity, the land of the free. It has been more than 10 years, and I have been anything but free. I am 26 years old, and I have not started my career. I am an illegal immigrant. I cannot graduate, drive or work (unless I do so illegally, which has never been my desire; breaking the rules has always been my worst nightmare). Doing the wrong thing completely paralyzes me. I do not suppose dad knew what he was doing when he moved us to this country. And yes, I could have left, but it does not work like that in our family, where the man of the house is the ruler and tyrant. Leaving meant having nowhere to go with no roof over my head or food in my stomach. I have always struggled to make friends, I guess they all have sensed the brokenness that is in me and ran the other way. As the months go by, my interest in people diminishes. I want to be left alone. do not talk to me, do not look at me, do not breathe on me (please ignore all this and love me anyways). Just give up on me and leave (please fight for me). I understand I am hard to love, which makes this decision a little easier. Dad, even though you were tough on me, I know you were just as broken as me. I do not want to follow in your footsteps. I tried. I really tried. But I am you. Mom, I love you so much and I am sorry. You do not deserve to lose your only daughter, but I cannot do this anymore. Hubby. You have tried your best to be patient and be there for me. But my presence is a burden that you do not deserve to handle. I hope you find love again.

Personality is defined as the collection of behavior, attitude, and ways of expressing emotions that makes a person unique.

Explaining using that Disney movie Inside Out as a metaphor.I do not cut myself for attention the last thing I want is attention. I am shrouded in self hatred so why would I want other people to pile onto that. I cut myself to feel control, to feel like I have a choice in the narrative that I am experiencing. it is the only way I know how.It would be like if the 5 main characters of the movie were living their life but there was also a secret 6th character, repression. He got thrown into that forgotten memories pit but he clawed his way back out holding a grudge. He broke into central control and is holding the other emotions hostage. They are forced to watch him ruin the life they made and cannot do anything about it. They have no control and can only watch what unfolds. They can give suggestions, like go to bed on time or exercise, but he will not take that advice. So finally, to feel some sense of control in this hell, they suggest something he will like.

I live with my family and I have just gone quiet. I do not talk much about anything because the thoughts on my head do not make for good conversation. I have stopped taking to a lot of people last year bc i felt they were not good friends for me and i was right i just do not have other friends to talk to. I do have one tho i game with but i have trouble talking about feelings with him too. I do not want advice when i talk to someone i guess that is why i do not. I do not want to be told to get out more and talk to strangers because i do not know how to do that. Or join clubs bc i already know that is a good way to meet people. but I am just discouraged the people i really like move away and we lose touch and i do not like that many types of people :( I just constantly listen to podcasts to fill the time when I am working on stuff but myself or gaming. I always feel like an outsider and i think being alone most of the time is making me worse at making friends. I do not even know what to do with friends like to hangout.

"So I had an okay day today. But of course that did not last when does it ever? I got in a fight with my mom as usual. Every time we fight I feel a little of myself die inside. Now there is basically nothing left of me. I noticed since I have become suicidal that I think about life a lot. Like not just what I want to do, and how I want to live (that is if I do not off myself first lol) but like in a bigger sense like why are we humans here? What is the point of us existing. Basically I have become very existential. So as I think of life as a whole everything really seems empty and pointless. Like even if I lived my idea of a perfect life I think Id still feel empty inside because what is the point of anything really?I feel like this is not something you can even tell someone in real life because they will think you are suicidal. Which I am I know but when I become existential and think of mankind as a whole and all that I am not suicidal. Like its a different feeling then when I want to die because my life sucks and when I am existential I just do not want to exist on this plane of existence because like what is the point. Do you get what I am saying!?Anyway I feel like this is not something humans are supposed to think about. Like if you say you do not want to exist because what is the point people will tell you your suicidal and that is wrong to want to die. But why should not I want to not kill myself? Why if I see how meaningless and small life is and do not want to be involved in it its wrong and I am supposed to seek help.

"I can't cope with my job I work from home as a software developer, most aspects of the job are too triggering, and I can’t handle it.

Every morning starts with a daily update meeting. Since I usually had done only 0-30 minutes of work the previous day, I have no update to give, I panic and have to lie, and the lie is transparent. Afterwards I have to cool down from the shame, guilt, and stress. It’s already hard to recover from the procrastination because everything I do, with the code or on Slack, has a timestamp, a notification, and is visible to everyone. Once there’s something I’m avoiding (committing code, deploying code, posting the code for review, responding to someone, testing code, an upcoming meeting, etc.) I often go offline from inactivity, and then I’m afraid to even open my laptop (which can take hours to overcome) because once I do everyone can see I’m online on Slack; my procrastination then is immediately visible to the people who are impacted and who are looking for it i.e. people I’m not responding to, my manager.

I already got in trouble for not doing my work, missing meetings, not responding to people for days or weeks, and just not showing up some days without telling anyone. I was put on a month-long probation, which I’ve gotten past only because I didn’t ghost entire days during that time. I have frequent meetings with my manager and I have to pretend I’m struggling way less than I am. I can’t admit that half or more of the days I do absolutely nothing, or how much communicating with people — the most important part of the job — so fundamentally terrifies me.

I know every trick in the book about procrastination, time management, breaking down tasks, but that’s not enough when I’m this afraid of people. I’ve accepted I need help from another person. I’ve talked about this some with friends, but none of them understand, so all they can provide is sympathy. I have a psychiatrist and I’ve been trying to find a therapist, but they’ve all been unhelpful, many actively harmful.

I know it's a slow process, but every single day at work is like torture, and I’m on very thin ice. Because I can’t get the work done, it’s not endurable, and I don’t have the time or energy to work on all the other parts of my life in dire need of work. I don’t want to quit because I haven’t been here that long and I had a big gap between quitting my previous job (for the same reasons). But I can’t stay like this for months until I find someone and begin making progress.

"Not sure where to start, I am finding life a constant struggle and I am tired and sick of it now. I feel like there is a massive weight crushing down on me. I cannot remember the last time I felt truly happy. I had an average childhood, my dad worked long hours so did not really build a relationship with him, my mam was the centre of the family. I suppose I will start when my family were involved in a horrific car accident, they all survived but sustained very severe injuries. My sister and mam were hurt the most, my sister was left with scars to her face but she battled through it and learn to live with it, my mam never really got over what happened to her. Life went on though and it became a memory we tried to forget. My mam then took Ill, she was diagnosed with cancer. We we all devastated but the surgeons had a plan and said they would fix it, she would survive but would need alot of surgery and rehabilitation, she went through the surgery and was on the road to recovery when she took her own life. Our world fell apart as you would imagine. She was a born worrier and I suppose the stress of it all just got too much for her. Again life went on although it was never the same again. I had my wife and children to focus on so the years passed as we carried on. I had the chance to take over and own the company I had worked at for many years so I took the opportunity to make a good life for my family,however the stress was immense and I could feel myself heading down and down into a breakdown, then I found out my wife had been having an affair with one of my best friends. This completely through me and destroyed every last thing I had in my life, I thought I could fix it, make it work with her but she no longer loved me so eventually I moved out. I set up home not far away from the family home and rebuilt my life for me and my children. I dated, had a few short relationships, then met someone who lives across the street, I thought this was the beginning of the rest of my life. Unfortunately, due to my wifes affair I now have trust issues, I find myself being controlling over my girlfriend. She continues to text her ex because they have 4 children together but this make me very anxious and causes alot of arguments between us. I have literally just told her we need to end our relationship because it is making me unhappy. To top this all off my sister has just been diagnosed with bowel and liver cancer, we were told its unlikely that its totally curable and that treatment will only slow it down. She adopted her son as a baby, hes now 9 years old, she is a single parent. My dad is not in the best of health but not life threatening, hes diabetic and struggles to control his sugar. I can see my life heading down a path I have no control over, I may lose my sister and dad over the next few years, I will be then responsible for raising my sisters adopted son, I have to work long hours to make ends meet but I do ok. I just feel like my whole like is falling apart and I am all alone. My kids are great but I only see them part time. Being completely honest they are the only thing keeping me going now but I am afraid that the way I feel that they might not be enough. I do not know what to do.

"Turning into alcohol Hey all. I'm getting worse. I've been battling depression ever since I finished high school, and it's been progressively getting worse. I thought getting a girlfriend would fix it, it doesn't. Nothing seems to help. I've come to realize life is pointless and it doesn't matter what I do to myself. I've been hurting myself, cutting, etc. and lately I've started drinking.

 It started with just a couple of nights of drinking on holiday. Then I realized hey I kind of like alcohol. Started to have a couple of beers a few times a week. Now I'm having them every night and bought my first large case of them ""just in case"" I wanna  have some beers the next night. 

I know this is a step to the worse and that I could stop right now with minimal discomfort. I just really don't care anymore and I want someone to notice I'm not okay because I can't really talk about it myself to the people I know. At the same time I don't want this to turn into full blown alcoholism because that would be bad, but at the same time I don't know if I even care that much anymore.

If I didn't have my family I would more than likely end my life.

Thank u for reading this far. I just needed some outlet and if anyone has words of comfort I'll happily hear them.",Depression,"{""category"": ""Depression""}",2025-04-21 05:45:09.356273,e5-large-v2
"So all of this began like a month ago. I was in the process of getting out of a depressed situation and was finally getting better. However right as this was happening a chain of terrible misfortunes started happening to me. First I broke my finger and almost poisoned myself in the same day. I am like whatever, shit day but it happens right? So a few days pass and I had pretty much fixed my mood from the shit day and I realized something was wrong with me (it is kind of private so I will not go in detail) but I googled it and it turns out it is a cancer syndrome. I instantly talked to a doctor but he said it I would have to wait a while for him to be available. So I spend the next 2 weeks torturing myself mentally imagining the worst case scenarios to a point where i prepared a knife to off myself if I was diagnosed with cancer. I went to the doctor a few days ago and the test results should be out tomorrow. I was once again starting to feel better and convincing myself that it is going to be alright when just a few hours ago I fell and broke my foot. Why are all of these bad things happening to me? Why are they all happening in such a short amount of time? I am laying on my bed in horrible pain and worrying about my foot, and tomorrow I could be diagnosed with a life threatening disease. If the test results are fine I would probably get in a car crash or something. I cannot take it anymore. When I try to tell my friends about my problems they reply with ""Sucks I guess"" or something like that, my parents do not care either. I am lonely and going thru the hardest time of my life.

I watch behind my computer screen as people go about their lives, making accomplishments and being social, while I just stay in my room and plot my useless ideas. Mostly I just want it to end. Except I have no way to kill myself and every time I have tried has not worked out? I feel most days that the cosmos is taunting me for something I did wrong, and cannot figure out how to make things better. Pain follows pain. In all, I know that I have no way out except death.Most people think that they know loneliness, but nobody knows it better than me. I have very few friends, most of all people view me as an oddity who they do not want to spend time with. I have no boyfriend or girlfriend and I am basically never going to because I am both autistic and asexual. The solitary life might not be so bad if I did not have this craving for human contact that I have had for years (I am now 22). All I long for is to go out with people but I have no way of meeting them. I was bullied in high school and had to drop out. At university, I could not seem to make any because I was too depressed by various things. Covid did not help. And so I have gotten to a stage where I feel like a complete outsider in society, hating myself and divorced from the norms of everyone else. I have very obscure interests, philosophy and literature, and art and movies. On top of that, I do not have any career both because I find it sustain one and my autism.I am an artist, except what good is that if nobody cares about my art? I have made albums of music that nobody really listened to and I was too depressed to advertise. I have also just finished a novel that nobody is going to read. I thought for the past few years that I could express the unique aspects of how I view the world through art, but I do not think it matters. Nobody is interested in me. I could self-publish my book and then nobody will read it. And so I feel constantly invisible, like a ghost that walks through people embedded in the world. I have been forgotten; I do not belong here; I am just a strange cosmic absurdity.And so what are my options in life, go on every day in perpetual misery and loneliness having had many years of proof that nothing gets better? I have no hope, and I can see myself in 10 years being in the exact same state of misery. I cannot bear the thought of continuing on this road, the endless pain.

"For anyone on the fence about journaling, this is my experience so far... So I enjoy journaling for a few different reasons, and as I continue to do it, and get better at it, the more natural it feels, allowing you to really make use of it and get something out of it. Before this recent journaling expedition I had NEVER journaled.  Maybe stupid little doodles and quotes from songs or something in notebooks, but not really journaling, or for any real purpose.  I was somewhat curious and interested in the idea, as it had always been suggested to me by programs, institutions, therapists, etc..  however, I couldn't get past my biggest hurdle which was how to begin journaling without feeling really, really, silly, or like some teeny girl in highschool writing about people she doesn't like or her crushes or whatever.  It just felt awkward and silly.  I debated on doing it for a while and I think one day I said to myself to just do it, see how it goes, and do it day after day or just twice a day, even if all I write is a sentence, or a gratitude, or a to do list, the idea was just to start doing it and developing the healthy habit.  So my first entries were very crude.  I'm looking at one now and it basically says : 

THC NJ is COOL
APPLY TO JOBS
START NEW RPG
GONNA COOK STEAK
START READING DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? (finished it that week)
THIS IS MY 1ST TIME JOURNALING
MAY ADD MORE LATER, lol
TALKED TO LILY BILLY, need to more often

Then l stated a short gratitude for the day.  This first journal entry I was grateful for reddit, cause I believe I made a post prior to writing that entry asking for tips on how to journal.  I posted on a few mental health groups, a few addiction or drug based subs, and a few writing subs and got all sorts of helpful tips, but my first few entries remained pretty crude for a week or so.  My first entry was on 2-12-23. So I've been doing it almost daily, some days multiple times in one day, and some weeks I'll go 3 or 4 days without journaling like just recently, but I don't like doing that cause now I notice a sort of disconnect from myself when I don't journal habitually.  It's constant confirmation of all your thoughts and beliefs, and you see how your idea develop and progress.  Thinking something and thinking something then writing it down on paper, physically putting the idea into the universe helps establish it.  

I skip a week or so into my journaling and now I'm talking to it more like how traditionally people think journaling goes.  Like raw free thought sort of, that's definitely a very important part of journaling though you can and will develop your own entire journaling style based on your needs, or what you want out of it.  I thought I would hate the free thought aimless formula but it's what I use the most now, because the habit of writing allowed me to get comfortable with it and explore it's benefits.   I just moderate it by USUALLY including short term, or long term goals, gratitudes,or something. But not always, if you don't feel it you shouldnt force yourself.  You don't wanna say a bullshit gratitude just to write something for gratitude.  If you don't feel it don't write it.  So yeah fast forward in my journal and I'm talking about the day we went to the park after group and we smoked a bit and played football and frisbee and saying how nice it is, before that  some goals and gratitudes.  Short term goals.  I begin to write about accomplishments I've made and things I see different in myself.  I talk about some of my inner growth but I'll mention a specific think like in how the past year and a half I've been fucked up like 20 of those days.  Or how I feel my brain is finally begin to repair itself cause I can feel some sort of natural euphoria at times.  Dopamine release is finally becoming more regulated.  I'll write how I finished a book in a week and that's also an accomplishment.  A big accomplishment I had to write down was hygiene.  When I was in heavy active addiction, or even sober just severely crippled with depression I'd go a month without brushing my teeth, weeks without showering.  So I wrote down that accomplishment.  It effects self esteem, ego and confidence.  When you go back and read goals you had and accomplishments you've made, on a daily basis you get to physically see growth or change in yourself instead of just feeling you're doing better.  You have written proof, you're logging your mental state everyday and you go back after a month when you forget what you wrote and you're like oh shit wow, I can't believe I actually accomplished that, or shit I can't believe I even WANTED. To accomplish that.  Being able to go back and read what you wrote after you forgotten it is a visceral feeling.   Theres no real WAY to journal and I'm still figuring out my best way but it changes, some days it's free thought, one day it's lists and goals and gratitudes, sometimes a healthy mix, sometimes it's something funny that happened that day (good to go back and read on funny moments you'd otherwise completely forget about, it can immortalize them so to speak) sometimes it's topics I wanna go down rabbit holes on YouTube and I'll mention it in the journal so that if I forget I'll  come back to that page on my own at some point and remember.  I could imagine how amazing it would be to have years worth of your own personal journals now.  Must be pretty fucking cool.  Get to see huge change in yourself and never forget where you started.  Reddit gave me an overwhelming amount of GOOD information and I took what I thought would work for me, still plan to read more on journaling tips soon as I wanna evolve it further and do more for with it, but I've been doing it for a like a little over a month so ill keep learning and adding journaling objectives as I continue doing it.  All in all journaling serves to strengthen your relationship with yourself.  I know my explanation wasn't the best, so I recommend also searching reddit or Google on your own for more journaling tips that work for your needs.

"Health issue or health anxiety So before i start, let me make clear that i do have some health issue Well had, i was born with a unicuspid valve and had open heart surgery 2 years ago. Up to the surgery i was a mental wreck more than before. Now after the surgery ive been Well for the most part. I have had alot of fears after that actually got worse over the two years instead of better. Now to start This story up we gotta rewind a few months, its a few days after Christmas, im at granny inlaw having a good time, when My  girlfriend notice My right ankle is a little swollen above the achilles tendon, we call the emergency eoc and he wants ud to Come in, he frels it and want it scanned with ultrasound. It was fine. Now i didnt Think much of it then, but im sure My ankle above the achilles always was swollen but i havent ever really looked much at My ancles.
Now here is where it gets difficult two days later we Are home, i wake up and notice i have a coin sized point bit left from My sternum with minor pain,and I get spells of dizziness.
At night i get admitted to the ER and they do ultra sound, ekg, bloodwork work etc. And everythings fine, except from slightly elevated troponin which could be scar tissue, though they think i have a minor infection in my heart and release me sayinf i should be fine sfter some time but i dont feel fine. Onde home i get This feeling  of not being able to get enough air when I breath. A week later im back in the ER, they do the  usual checks plus a ct and guess what, im fine except for the same slightly elevated troponin and they release me Again sayings its just a minor infektion. 
3 weeks later i have an appointment with a specialised cardiologist that is educated for valve disease and has byen following me for over a decade. She checks me and im fine My heart is in a good condition. Now i didnt feel happy when told so, but extreme dissapointment, i started to get a feeling of fear of Them having made a mistake or missed something . The reason being is that before My surgery the hospital i was in the ER at, didnt see that My heart wasnt doing Well when I was in for chest pain(wasnt a heart attack, but My valve failing badly) the Same pain i have Now. 
Now i startede going to a psych every third week and its good. But at this point im uncertain of what is wrong, ive been checked at the hospital 3times and at a specialized cardiologist, and they havent found much that could explain the pain.
So im trying to accept the fact it could be anxiety driven, but the moment i started trying it, i got issues with breathing Again. Its like something in me wants to keeper me in pain and afraid.

"Feeling very lonely Today I saw a Snapchat of around 6 coworkers having a bday party for my other coworker, who I considered a friend. We've only known each other for a year, but I thought we've gotten along great. I thought I got along with everyone pretty well. But I didn't hear anything about a party and now I feel incredibly alone again. I've always been the shy anxious kid, I've had maybe 3 good friends max all the way up through highschool. And since then we've all gone out separate ways. I feel like I'm never someone's first choice. Usually people don't talk to me unless I initiate. And it gets tiring, being the only one putting effort into a relationship. It sucks, I thought I was getting along well with everyone and now I'm realizing it's the same shit.

"Being up north in a cabin in the woods, snow and pines all around. Alone, trees and mountains all around. Alone. Crossing the room, the floorboards creaking under foot, the weight of my footprints are one last mark alive on this earth. The cold wind hitting the walls of the outside. Pulling a handgun out from the drawer in the corner. Placing it in my mouth, or on the side of my head? on my temple? whichever way it is with full intentions to pull the trigger. Am I really meant to stay alive? Was told to stay alive, but for what? Only to create more misery? The ones who have said it disappeared in the wind. To stay alive to not exist? To live only to wish to end this misery, wishing to end this thing called living? We all meet the earth in our deteriorating bones eventually. I have no legacy. I will be forgotten like the ones before me. I think these things as I am pressing the ball of the barrel to my temple. I think of him, who first said to me to stay alive even though he disappeared and said to never call back. Why am I still here? I want to cry, to scream to take this pain away. Am I really going to give in to living or just end it all? TAKE THIS PAIN AWAY! End MY MISERY! I lower the gun and fold into a ball. The gun lay at my head, the gun laying in full sight. I stare at it, conscious of the outside, the wind shifting frame of this cabin. I close my eyes and pray I no longer want to be alive. To fall asleep. To wake up alive. I want to die!

"i’ve had a rough week :/ this is literally just me going to vent bc i don’t have anyone rn and i feel like talking to a community that knows what i might be going through is more comforting than talking to people who i know aren’t going to get it or will worry them. 

so last Thursday my friend and I got into a big fight over me not answering my phone , the jist of that is i was called selfish and told i throw a pity party for myself every time I talk about my relationship with my mother ( it’s bad and has only gotten worse as im am adult now ) as well as her insinuating that i undermine their relationship with their parents ( which i do not , because that is not the type of person i am for whatever that’s worth ) and it ended with us blocking each other which is something i initiated bc I couldn’t deal with how uncommunicative she was being it alone interfered with a lot of other plans, like us going to prom together so now im torn about even going to that since it’ll be my senior prom but then the idea of being outside is to much 

so that Monday was my birthday and I had invited two other friends of mine , one of which I was supposed to be moving in with and had been planning to do so for years only for her to tell me the night i turn 18 that she doesn’t see it being realistic , which is fair and I’m not angry with her but it just seems like my life is falling apart , and I know in the future this won’t even matter but i am having borderline suicidal thoughts and can feel my depression getting so ugly that I can’t even look in mirrors or think about my future. 

i feel really lost and I’m trying to stay positive and have my perspective be that of gratitude but I’m struggling and im just so fucking scared about what I’m going to do in my life. I was thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend but I can’t even trust that the thought is mine or just my brain going into overdrive. I can’t even look people in the eye anymore . I just want to sleep and I want to run away and just go somewhere but I know that’s my avoidance talking. 

don’t really know why im posting this , i think maybe I want to hear about your stories of overcoming things and getting to where you are now or just to know somebody else understands.",Bipolar,"{""category"": ""Suicidal""}",2025-04-21 05:50:57.705407,e5-large-v2
"I hope this makes you feel better Society expects us to have kids, house, nice car and a “successful” career to be “happy”.

We’re brainwashed into following this “dream” right from school and put ourselves through great deal of stress pain and suffering.

Unless you’re born into wealth you have to give your life away and work for someone else’s dream with the tales that one day you will have the same amount of wealth and along the way you’re reminded how far away you are and compare yourself to others that have just that bit more than you.

You sacrifice your life, freedom, health, relationship all for some pocket change and a supposed wealth while others are milking from your sacrifice this making you feel like a failure, feeling like that dream is further and further away.

It’s a mindset you need to teach yourself, a mindset where your head is clear and at every obstacle you need to tell yourself no matter what it is that you’ll be fine because LIFE IS TOO SHORT AND CAN CHANGE IN AN INSTANT and then when your health suffers all of these aspirations and dreams do not matter.

I’ve been incidentally diagnosed with cancer - was very lucky as they’ve cut it out fairly quickly, only 3 nights in hospital, painless procedure. I’ve won a lucky dip with life because it was nothing, but seeing people who care about me being so upset was a horrible experience.

I wanted them to be happy and stop worrying because I’ve never thought much of myself then why would they? Because I am nothing, I am not worth anything, low self esteem, never had any aspirations, goals, only liked cars, wasn’t very social, couldn’t really talk to people and sat in my own head alot.

Showing how much those close to me cared for me made me change. When I lay in hospital my head was clear, didn’t worry about work, buying a house, savings or career. Only my family mattered and that’s how I’ve learned this mindset and began adapting my life around it, got rid of as much finance as I could, paid off my phone, sold the BMW bought a cheap Fiat for cash. Financial freedom helped with not worrying about money. Began saving money for a deposit for my new house in the future.

I keep reminding myself to enjoy the little things in life, going for a walk, going to a gym or even buying something fancy to eat here and there on my weekly shop, going restaurant and getting a carbonara or a new phone case. I’ve started eating healthy and looking after my health. I feel happy, proud of myself and I live week by week.

Of course I am aware I am very lucky and not everyone has the same opportunities in life and do not wish to upset anyone by this post. I hope this helps someone to find their path in life.",Stress,"{""category"": ""Normal""}",2025-04-21 05:51:08.366130,e5-large-v2

She called me crying and sobbing loudly from the hospital yesterday. She told me that she told him he did not want to be with her anymore. She basically crumbled. Her mom called me today and told me that she tried to take her life but they found her in time. I really dislike the boyfriend, if I am honest, I have never been a fan of him. Hes always seemed off to me, distant. But as her friend I always made the effort to support her decision to be with him. Right now she is still hospitalized and crying inconsolably. Her psychiatrist is traveling to where she is (she is out of town, about 18 hours driving away). I feel really sad that i cannot be there for her and her mom.

"Friends Is it normal to constantly worry about my actions around my  friends?

I [M] started worrying about whether my friends, or at least my general ones, were just about putting up with me. I feel as if I am unwanted around people I consider friends. Conversations seem to start with being lightly involved ( since I'm present at the start) and seem to be directed at other people, say I was with 2 others they would talk between themselves. 
I may be overreacting which is probably the case but it seems when playing football during breaks at school, I seem in no way involved like my other friends are.
People I like as friends seem to disregard me in most things, for example if I had a group project of some description with groups of 6, I seem to be the 7th person constantly.

I also feel that I do not want to let go of my friendships, how rough it may be on me, due to me having no other people to turn with.
I don't want to be alone, that seems like a bad life to lead but again it appears that sometimes, for others sake not just mine, me distancing myself from them would not be bad.

"Advice I’ve been dealing with some anxiety issues my whole life. I’ve had lots of trama and was diagnosed with ADHD as a young child. Never being able to focus and always the most loud and distributive( in school). I used to stay up at night as a kid because after watching the slightest scary movie I would be afraid. Anyways the point of the backstory is to give you a sense of who I was. Lately within the past year my anxiety has been through the roof. I find it very hard to focus and have lots of thoughts at once. Even some that just pop into my head. I can hear other peoples tone of voice. Not like big conversation. My anxiety was so high I was getting lots of physical symptoms heart palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath to which I thought I had a heart problem. So I went to the doctors and got all the tests and didn’t believe my heart was fine until I got the results. I thought about this everyday. To which now I think this might had been a delusion. My point is I’m very worried I’m developing Schizophrenia. My family does have a history of mental health issues.I know this post is confusing and if I’m worried about my mental health I should see a doctor. But I’m just looking for advice.

"Is this normal psych hospital procedure? A few years ago on my 16th birthday I was sent to a psych hospital and stayed there for a week. Some things happened there that scared me and I'm not sure if it was standerd psych hospital procedure and I'm overeacting, or if their procedures are abnormal. I was voluntarily admitted due to bipolar disorder. I wasn't on the medicine I needed, and since it was an emergency, I went to the psych hospital. During my time there they had a skin check. At first I didn't know they were doing, they just told me to undress myself and be naked. They didn't ask if being naked in front of other people made me uncomfortable, they didn't ask if I was menstruating,  they didn't ask if I had been sexually assaulted. I was confused and thought they were going to sexually assault me, so I started crying. They then told me either I undress myself or they would restrain me. By then I was crying uncontrollably. I begged them to not make me undress myself. I let them touch under my clothes because I didn't want them to see my breasts. They forced me to take off my underwear which was uncomfortable since I was menstruating. It probably doesn't seem like much to be scared of, but when the only person you've allowed to see your private parts is your pediatrician due to yearly check-up and that it is required, and I have had the same pediatrician for several years so I trust her, it was a big deal to me. I was stuck at the hospital for a week, they said they would let me home on Friday but then said I had to stay over the weekend even though the insurance didn't cover weekends, so the hospital bill put my family in some debt. My family can afford a house, food, utilities and all that, but we aren't middle class, we get free lunch at school and help from the government. Hospital bills are notoriously high in the united states, and the medicine I'm on costs more in the united states than it does in third world countries and the developing world. My parents asked that I be released from the hospital, but their request was denied even though I was voluntarily committed. Also, the psych hospital had zero privacy. No locks on doors, the shower curtain was clear. Everyone had a roommate, mine treated me terribly, and so I was worried she'd come in when I was in the bathroom or showering and see me. The psych hospital was tiny, it was a hallway with rooms on each side, some bedrooms, a room to eat, and a desk where a lady gave you meds. They made you go to groups, but the medicine they put me on made me super tired and knocked me out. Best sleep I've had, but it made the nurses and doctors angry that I wasn't participating in groups and instead, sleeping. Or trying to sleep, rather, since the psych hospital was so small and crowded that every little noise echoed. I often hear people say psych wards make them feel safe and calm, but my experience was far from it.

So December 30th of 2020 while I was laying in bed trying to fall asleep a feeling of loneliness and sadness came over me is the best way I could describe it and I figured by the time I wake up it would be gone, when I woke up the next morning I still felt that way and decided to get ready in the dark and on my drive up to work I did not have the radio on listening to music like I normally would, when I got to work I asked my boss which route I would be doing and I started typing in the addresses on my phone and whenever I type address is in I use voice dictation, so every time I would speak an address in that morning I kept feeling this urge like I wanted to cry and the more I kept speaking the stronger it got so eventually I started typing them in with my finger and several times before dispatch my manager walked past me and I wanted to tell him so bad that I was not feeling well mentally and that I was not all there I was so close to telling him yet I could not bring myself to do it so finally fast forward to after they dispatch us instead of telling my manager that I am not feeling well mentally I told him that I was hungover..... I felt like I would have been judged if I would have told him that I was not feeling all there mentallyAnd one more incident here recently happened where me and a friend went to a bar and on our way over there I kind of get this familiar feeling of like loneliness and sadness and when we get into the bar and sit down they ask what we want to eat and drink and I was not in the mood for anything so I did not order anything I pretty much just stared off into space while we were there and after we left the bar we walked around the little shopping center area that it was in and then before we got back to my truck there was a park nearby with two Bridges that cross over a trail so I told my buddy that I was going to go take a piss and I would be right back I walk in between the two Bridges and sit down on the embankment or whatever the hell you call that thing and then I cried for about 5 to 10 minutes for absolutely no reason whatever And the background I would say the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020 I had made plans to go play pool with a coworker and right before I got to the pool hall they Called said that they could not go so I ended up going by myself and stayed there until about 2:00 a.m. playing pool by myself realizing that I was getting more and more lonely I decided to leave and drive to the park on the way there the feeling got stronger and when I got to the park I shut my truck off and cried for about a good 5 minutes at least and texted one of my co-workers that he was better at his job than I was at mineI honestly do not know if I am depressed or just lonely, because that feeling is not always constant, it is not always persistent 24/7 I think I might have depression",Depression,"{""category"": ""Depression""}",2025-04-21 06:01:47.617546,e5-large-v2

"Hello, I want to apologize for the very low level of English I have, I am not a native English speaker. I have been diagnosed with depression and have had TBIs with a psychiatrist since 2017. It has been very episodic as it is depression that starts through trauma or PTSD. I come to seek help here because my appointments are too short and distant from each other. I am looking for advice / discussion about this, although I have done this a lot in the past and feel like I have heard it all. Currently in my life it is rather quiet. No big event for 3 weeks, things are stable at this level. In fact, I want to completely detach myself from human relationships and even emotionally from things, already that I am ultra jaded and bored by everyone (music, sport, video games, literature, animated, ...) my passions do not stimulate me not as much as before. I also have all the things that I like + my ""Madeleine de Proust"" which fall, become null or stop lately. I am an only child and have a great relationship with my parents, but having to see their health deteriorate and the fact that my mother almost died of illness recently plays a big role. I have also experienced a lot of relationship disappointments, even I have hardly experienced that. Recently I have seen the true thoughts of my rare strong relationships. It hurts me but I accepted that deep down I get too attached and that all relationships are led to an end. Time erodes them and if it is not time it will be weariness. I have heard everything at this level, I have introspected a lot, applied advice but I only come to one conclusion: I have to detach myself emotionally from things. Everything ended up going badly in my life, hope made me suffer and I literally have no purpose in life anymore. I do not feel like killing myself, but I am tired and jaded with life. Literally everything is bad, everything sucks and it does not even make me want to try something new because things go wrong every time. Level of relationships, in love it is too complex and it causes more problems than good things and in friendship I believe that the true friendship that we see in the works does not exist. I have a strong relationship but I think I got too attached and I make the same mistakes over and over. In short what do you think?

"RISPERIDONE 1MG Tablet Hi everyone..
Yesterday I saw a psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with bipolar, schizophrenia, manic depression and anxiety. 
He gave me this medication called risperidone in 1mg tablet form. After reading lots of negative posts online about it, I'm terrified to take this. Suppose to take it in the morning, not sure if that cause it could interact with my Tramadol prescription that is taken at night as a sleep aid. 
Was wondering if anyone may be comfortable sharing there experiences with this medication? Also, how bad do you think it would effect the creative portion of ones mental state?

"Looking for advice for stomach pain from stress TL/DR: I recently transitioned off anti-depressants and have started to get stomach pain again.

After 17 years on anti-depressants, I finally transitioned off them. Buspirone and bupropion were a godsend, but I completely went numb. I couldn’t experience emotions at all. So I decided to see what life was like in the normal world again. I have historically carried my stress in my stomach. My brain doesn’t know I’m stressed, but my stomach will hurt like crazy.

"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",Depression,"{""category"": ""Normal""}",2025-04-21 06:03:32.882050,e5-large-v2

"I do not even know what to write, i just feel very sad, angry and frustrated about the limitations of my very small brain. I have always been the stupider of the group and since i was a kid, people always have made fun of my intelligence. My family, the friends i used to have, the teachers and pretty much everyone that had the displeasure of knowing me, they all naturally converged to the acknowledgement of my own stupidity (i do not even know if this sentence makes sense in english... if not, i am sorry about my poor english.). I am actually surprised i somehow managed to live for 24 years but i hope that soon, my stupidity will succeed in what it is supposed to succeed: kill the bearer of the bad genes. But you know, i am too stupid for that like i am too stupid for many others things. In the shitty life i lived, I have always had to confront with my very limited intelligence every single time i tried to do something. I used to love history but i had to give up because my brain could not afford to retains all that informations, i used to love playing piano but i had to give up because my brain could not afford the ability to perform polyrhythms, i used to love drawing but had to give up because perspective was too complicated for my brain to be handled... I could go on with a very long list of things i tried to do but miserably failed because of my very low iq. Because that is what is all about in the end. And no, i do not have any learning disability or other related issues, i am just a plain and simple stupid person with a pitifully low iq.

With the small brain i have, i would have hard time with the simplest of the job that pays minimum wage... Do you think is that a life worth to living?

Where you cannot understand how the hell works the world you are living in? Should i just go on with money and just forget how unlucky i was at birth? Should i just accept a life of complete ignorance?

"Hi all, I relate deeply to a lot of the posts I see on this page and I would like to offer some encouragement.There was a long period of time where I was in complete isolation and the pandemic further isolated me. I turned to negative things to cope with the depression and loneliness like mind-numbing television, alcohol, and hanging out with people that were toxic for me due to the fear of being alone.After years of therapy and growth, I wanted to share some words of encouragement for all my lonely hearts out there &lt;3* Being afraid of being alone is totally normal.* The reason you may feel so alone is because you are not sharing with anyone your feelings. You are not being seen/heard in the way you need to be seen/heard. I hope this post helps you connect in some way to know that you are not alone and many others have gone through the same/similar thing.* Growing love and respect for someone else requires time spent with that person. Over time, you may fall in love or grow great respect for people that show you who they are, what they value, how they talk/act, etc. what is the difference between that and growing self-love &amp; self-respect? You must spend that time with yourself to grow that love and respect for yourself. Alone time can be seen as an opportunity if we look at it this way.* To feel less alone, meditating for 5 minutes a day, journaling, and shadow work exercises can help you. A shadow work exercise that really helped me (that I learned through my spiritual journey/therapy) is to look at yourself in a mirror and ask yourself questions - you will be surprised what comes out.* Start some hobbies, anything and everything that you can afford to do. If it ends up flopping, that is okay. You can move onto the next thing and remember, you have time.* Over time, you will hopefully realize that time alone gives you the opportunity to do what you want, recharge, and protect your energy from people.* We are quick to defend others when they are talking negatively about themselves e.g. your friend says ""I am so ugly"" or ""I am so fat"" or ""I am so worthless"" - we immediately tell them they are not and give them a plethora of compliments to negate it. But when we are doing negative self-talk, we just feed into that and feed into that. You must be kind to yourself, you must defend yourself. Tell yourself you are having a bad day and know that it will get better.These are just some things that have helped me along my journey of feeling very lonely. I hope some of these things help you &lt;3TLDR; I have a YouTube video regarding these topics that I go into further. In my video, first I tell you my story, then I go into the pros/benefits of spending time alone, and then I finish with some friendly suggestions on what you can do alone. You can find my video by searching ""kelly guidance how to stop feeling alone spiritual chat.""You are never alone. I am sending you all so much love and light. Remember to always be kind to yourself and others. One day at a time.

"I have fucked everything up and let it go on so long it is irreparable. I can barely handle day to day life as it is I cannot even imagine trying to fix things on top of it. there is absolutely nothing that brings me enough joy in this world to make up for all the stupid bullshit we have to put up with just to exist. Nothing I do ever ends up making a difference. Every attempt to improve myself has left me worse off than before. I tried to go to college, that just led to me getting bullied like a bad teen drama. I worked so fucking hard and went so far out of my comfort zone and my professors did not give a shit. None of them remember me, I cannot get any references and I have not gotten a job in over 2 years of looking. I just spent three years and $16000 in absolute misery.I tried to improve my relationship with my family. But everything I do they see through a negative lense. No matter what I do, they manage to spin it so that I come out selfish, spoiled and lazy. I tried to improve my figure by working out, but now I am just skinny in places I need fat, fat in places I need to be skinny, and have unfeminine muscle mass in random places. And surprise surprise, it did not shrink my massive ribcage or reduce my hipdips or help straighten my spine. I tried hair removal, now I have unsightly strawberry legs and the hair grows back funny. I started moisturizing and wearing sunscreen, but the damage is already done so it just leaves me looking like a greasy pig. I tried taking birth control to help cope with my period, but it made it worse. And when I went off it, my boobs shrunk. I was already barely an A cup. And losing what little volume I had in the front just accentuates my kyphosis. I have always been ugly but I look so much worse, you would think I would let myself go rather than finally start taking care of myself. I am embarrassed to run into people I used to know. And it is only going to get worse with age. I am so fucking anxious about ageing. Knowing how much uglier I have steadily become over just the past 5 years, I cannot imagine what 40+ more will do.I cannot be happy living alone. I have tried but it is just too easy to spiral when there is no one to distract you. And you feel so isolated. I know if I ever committed to living alone, I would just give up completely. I will not get any sleep, then I will be too anxious and apathetic to go to leave the house, so I will just lie in bed and stare at my phone, while leaving the house gets harder and harder, and I will end up starving to death. But a relationship is not an attainable goal for me. Straight men hate my guts. They pointedly ignore me at best. Even if someone is desperate enough to give me a shot, they will never like me. I am too repulsive and awkward and cringey and annoying. I have no prospects in life. I am pretty much just bumming around my parents house til they get sick of me and kick me out. I have no prospects for a career, relationship, independence, friendship, a happy life. Everything is too hard and complicated and I have too many regrets. I am just not cut out for life.

When the pandemic hit I was hitting the bottle a little too hard like finishing a bottle tequila every other day. I sought help from the therapists we have at work. We get 6 sessions and for whatever reason this therapist saw how broken I was and continued therapy for a whole year without mentioning our limit has long been passed. He finally did this past week. I knew it was coming and bless his heart for going above and beyond. I am completely sober but just as depressed. I cannot fathom opening up all over again. I am sinking and this time I am not even trying to save myself. My hygiene has been horrid I am glad we have lotion and perfumes to hide the worst of it. To make matters worse my so called friends decided to go out without inviting me but had the nerve to send me tons of photos of how much fun they were having. I blocked them all. Its exhausting even contemplating therapy from scratch. Its scary not having a lifeline yet its so difficult reaching out for help. Thanks for reading.

I have pretty much always been depressed. Like since I could remember. When I was little I was always a little sad but never to that extreme but as I got older every day gets harder and harder. I am a teen and online schooled. Whenever I get out of bed (if i do at all) getting work done is the last thing on my mind. I just have this terrible brain fog and I have trouble processing everything around me. My room is so messy I can barely walk through it. It is not dirty like gross or anything but everything I own is scattered across my floor. I am to tired to take care of myself and I cannot even hold a conversation without getting angry. I am on medication that actually helps quite a bit so I have no clue what it would be like without it. I try to find a therapist but whenever I go it is like I temporarily trick myself into thinking that I am fine and completely refuse to go. Many of my friends are going off to college and I do not have the energy to maintain a long distance friendship or make new ones. I am falling behind in every aspect of my life. I try to make systems to help myself out but I wish I could just have someone come and put my pieces back together so that I can resume life.

I want to feel something other than inadequacy and pitifulness.Over the past few days I have come to the fact that I have an eating disorder, and I have been living with it for probably a little over 2 years and it has gotten progressively worse with age. I have also been thinking about how I talk to others. I have realised that I am too nice and I let people walk all over me, or I let mean comments pass by. I have decided I am not going to do that anymore, and when someone says something that I do not agree with, I am going to stand up for myself. I feel like a fraud. I feel like I am putting on thus facade to people to please people. Because I must admit it without being vain, I am...different than most people. I dress weird, I like old music, I am wiser than my fellow sixteen year old peers and I am a lot more articulate than my peers and that is probably because I read the classics and enjoy poetry. I am an intellectual person and in my family I am a black sheep, because everyone around me is a lot more shallow than I when speaking about topics and they just like different things than me. So when I am around other people, it is better not to speak than to say something that does not fit their norm and be laughed at and made fun of. To be honest, I would rather be alone than be in a group of people who share no interests than me. To me, that is probably the worst thing to deal with...people you just do not click with.

I wish I knew what I could have done differently or maybe should not have read too much into things to begin with. Am I the only one that is dealt with this?

i tried calling a hotline today for people in need or something like that. i am feeling quite shitty and i have been thinking about suicide more and more so i wanted to talk to someone about it but i feel like my problems are not bad enough to call a hotline. i always have to think that maybe someone else is who is actually going to commit suicide would call and then the line would be full because of me. i do not actually think i will kill myself. i just think of it sometimes. so my problems are not even that bad or? well instead of calling i decided to write this out and post here.

I feel unable to cope with the difficulty of life.I have an appointment online with my therapist but I obviously cannot say anything about being suicidal or having bad thoughts.

It does eventually pass once i realise they are sticking by me. Some just cant stick it out which is fair enough. I find it frustrating though as i have just drove someone away who i really liked. He has ended up deleting and blocking me as he didnt at all help with reassurance which just made my mind go into overdrive creating scenarios that were probably non existent.
