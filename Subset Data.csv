"If you do not love someone or cannot promise to love them until you die then do not get into marriages. Its a different kind of pain when you see one parent not be happy in the relationship and it depresses you real hard. It fucking hurts man. If someone gives birth to a child in a failed marriage its like giving the child guaranteed emotional issues, depression and suicidal thoughts and anxiety and frequent panic attacks. I beg you.

I have been cheated on. When I confronted her I was jailed after being physically assaulted and now have to face a trial. She abused me and cheated on me but I am the criminal who has to fight a sexist system. In the gap of time until the trial I have tried moving on and getting back on my feet but no woman wants me. No job will hire me. My birth was a mistake anyway according to my mother. My suffering needs to end but I lack the guts to go through with ending it.

"so, this might be a little long. sorry about that in advance anyway.like the title said I have no idea what I am doing with my life, not trying to feel sorry for myself by posting this or anything I just do not know what to do anymore. I had a very complicated childhood, my parents never let me get an education. (and by that I mean not at all, I never did any school work, or even went to school at all when I was a kid/teen.)my spelling is almost nonexistent and no matter how hard I try I cannot seem to improve it (using a mix of autocorrect/google translate to write this out) and my math is awful, but I did manage to teach myself to read quite well though.I was not allowed to talk to other kids growing up and so I had no friends growing up and was not allowed to leave the house at all, only sometimes to go shopping with my dad or mom. and I went out even less after my father killed himself when I was 8.the first time I talked to someone/went outside by myself was when I was 16 and it was to get milk and other stuff because my mom just got too lazy and she could not be bothered anymore I suppose. as you probably guessed I have extreme social anxiety and can barely talk to other people even till this day.this might sound awful and I feel awful for saying this, but covid is probably the best thing to ever happen to me I was able to move out with one of my sisters because of government benefits, because of this I was able to look inward and able to see how badly I was treated by my family and to see that I might have a lot of mental problems because of this.I do not know how I thought my home life was normal, but I had my mom calling me useless because I was unable to get a job and pay her rent, and most of my siblings treated me like dirt acting grossed out just from seeing me, and some of them even used to tell me that: I should kill myself because no one would miss me anyway"".the only people in my family I am close with are my two little sisters and my older brother though he cut everyone in our family off including me because his wife does not like any of us which hit me hard.my family has pretty much fallen apart a surprise to anyone reading this I am sure haha.so that brings us to today I am 23 years old have no education, do not have any friends, I cannot get a job, and I Might be homeless soon.I am seeing a psychologist soon. I do not think it will help me much honestly. I wake up every day scared of being homeless I cannot relax anymore, I do not enjoy anything in life anymore. for anyone who is worried I do not think I am suicidal, but I am honestly finding it hard to find a reason to live anymore.to anyone who made it to the end of this probably very badly spelled post, Thank you.

"Health anxiety about Multiple Sclerosis? For the past year i have had neurological symptoms that lead me to googling then becoming fixated on MS. I started getting muscle twitches all over and on my mouth particularly, then a tingling/buzzing  heel of my left foot, muscle soreness on my arms, tingling tip of nose and scalp, various shooting pains and horrible neck pain. This was all on and off. My foot has been “buzzing” for months and months on and off. I had cancer when I was younger and my doctors think I just have health anxiety, or neuropathy from old chemo (which is uncommon) anyways i got a new doctor and she scared me more because she told me “it doesnt sound like full blown MS but i can do some tests” basically even though she said it didnt sound like it, she still didnt rule it out. that was enough to scare me into a spiraling panic. I google my symptoms every day, read up On MS and i’m fully convinced i have it. I even posted on the MS forum here but now I wonder if it could all just be anxiety. I’m terrified. I’ve been obsessing over this for a year now. I haven’t had any debilitating symptoms like numbess or pins and needles or vision loss.

"Depressive episodes are not forever One thing that gets me through my episodes is the knowledge that it can't last forever. For several years before I was diagnosed I only really experienced depression (no hypomania at all) and it felt like it would never end. And I know that a fair amount of people also feel this way. And some people suffer from chronic depression. But now with my diagnosis I feel that as long as my episode lasts and however intense it is it can't last forever. 

I guess it's just a small solace. But on the flip side, when I was just depressed I held on to hope that one day I would be cured but with bipolar that hope is pretty much squashed. So I guess it's a mixed bag.",Bipolar

"Newly Diagnosed and Drugged Hi there, I was recently diagnosed with BP II.  This is all very new to me.  All my life my doctors bounced me around treatments for anxiety, ADHD, and depression without any real results.  The worst of these was a doc in college who insisted I needed to take high-dose Adderall which turned me into a 95 pound skeleton of a crackhead.  Depression meds made me a zombie.

My psychiatrist now is (sort of) working in conjunction with my therapist.  I say sort of because after therapist sent me to psych for treatment for ""mood disorder"", he prescribed for ADHD.  I wasn't really surprised, but had tried to explain to him in office that I was a hot mess because I was travelling across the country the next day, and that I was nervous because it was my first time meeting him.  Of course I couldn't concentrate and was fidgety and talking fast. :\

Anyway, those meds made me feel awful, so after taking them for a month, I stopped.  Yesterday he prescribed Lamictal, and today is my first day taking it.  What can I expect?  how has it helped any of you?  Were the side effects bad?  I am also taking Trazodone, given to me by my primary doc for sleep issues.  Psych upped the dose of Trazodone to 100 mg and gave me a starter dose of 25 mg Lamictal, to be increased over the next few weeks.",Bipolar
"Self(ish) Rant I've generally been the kind of person who when bad news is received my brain can take awhile for it to sink in.

They asked if I was okay how I was holding up how my mom was holding up.
But the thing that irks me down to the core is that all of the sudden it took the death of a family member to think I might not be alright. They never thought to ask or say anything the multitude of days I called in sick or didn't call in at all and just didn't show up. They just don't understand, I'm not depressed today. I'm depressed almost every day. It just makes me feel that without a, in their opinion, legitimate reason to be depressed I'm the one in the wrong. Maybe they just considered me lazy and apathetic up until this point. ",Bipolar
"Vyvanse and Bipolar 2 I don’t have ADHD or Binge Eating Disorder, let me preface this with that.

I recently did some genetic testing through my psychiatrist and the results came back that I would highly benefit from stimulants, if I had the need to take them.(Also said I should never take SSRIs and all atypical antipsychotics will make me gain weight- fun facts) I know it’s very uncommon, and I’ve read some horrible things about having bipolar and taking stimulants (mania, psychosis, etc) but my pdoc put me on 20mg to see if it could help with my cognitive and executive function.

Does anyone have experience with taking Vyvanse without one of the regular prescribed  diagnosis?

Also, if you take Vyvanse just in general, how did you deal with the crash? First day taking it and I feel like hell, it’s been about 10-11 hours since I took it now.

"Actually you're a total badass Most people are mentally and emotionally sane, relatively at least. They might claim that the worry is all in your head, not understanding that your corporeal experience strongly suggests otherwise. They might tell you to think positive, because they don't have an inner voice that constantly gets drowned out by a huge stadium packed with negative objectors. They might take it rather personally when socializing is the very least thing you want to do, they could never imagine that them yapping on about their normal life drains your already depleted life-energy. Some of them might start all kinds of shit with you because they see you as a weak and opportune victim to unload their own shit towards, never realizing they're the real cowards.

Some of them might truly want to help you out and tell you get therapy asap, then you might see some random bureaucrat person completely devoid of empathy struggling to stay awake while you pour you heart of desperately looking for some kind of assistance. Assistance that usually comes in form of dubious drugs that only work at a hefty price by the way So they advice you to go see some private expensive experts, unaware of the fact that your wallets suffers with you. They like to imply that you just chill the f out and relax. Because they don't have that intrusive, horrible, horrible, horrible, encompassing, joy-devouring, soul-obliterating, sucking, painful, torturous, uneasy pit of dread stuck right in their stomach with racing thoughts to boot. Perhaps they'll make sly remarks on how you need to just grow up, after all, they don't know how's it's like to think like an adult while emotionally reacting like a little fragile child scared to death.

They might say go the gym or be physically active and get some endorphins running. To be fair, is actually solid advice if you can muster the strength to go there. Off course they have their problems too, the difference however is that your problem is you and how that you contaminate every aspect of your life. The point is, according to some of 'them' you're just a loser, useless, lazy, afraid, a waste of space, a failure with nothing to show for in life. They are so much better than you and intentionally or not they make you buy their version of you.

However. It's just opinions from judgemental people at the end of the day. I don't want to you to waste any energy on harboring any resentment, envy or anger towards anybody, they just don't understand. How could they know the truth. Perhaps even you don't the truth about yourself, so I'm going to say it, just in case.

You simply being here and keeping on makes you a tough as nails. A warrior that fights hordes of demons every day. Bravery is defined by the will to face fear, you have fear stuffed in your face all the time. You may suffer endless anxiety, but you as a matter of fact are courageous by the definition of the word. Doing your best to just keep going, that's it. It's not some lofty motivational speech, just a cold fact.

It may not help you any bit to read this, but I for one will not let it be unsaid. Anxiety is bad enough in itself, so rather than feeling shame in addition you have earned the right to have pride in yourself. My intention is for you to keep that in mind on your darkest days, because I know very well what it's like to suffer anxiety while having your character measured by factors out of your control.",Anxiety

"Hi, I hope that you are okay.I am not, unfortunately. Its the second depressive episode of my life, and idk if Ill survive this one.I have abandonment trauma and each time a separation occurs, I get depressed. The more attached, the worse.My first episode happened 4 years ago and was due to leaving high school and my home town.My therapist, my family and friends helped me through. But the one who helped me the most was my boyfriend. I always thought that I would never meet a guy like those in books. And yet I did. The second we started talking I knew he was special. How odd a feeling.During three years and a half I grew better alongside him. I started loving life in its smallest forms like insect and seeds, learnt almost everything I know about nature and started caring about myself to take better care of others. If there is anything such as soulmates in this world, he is mine. Yet due to that covid nightmare and my failing at passing a specific exam, we have lived apart since March 2020, and he could not bear it. I have not been the best GF in a distance relationship since I have a strong sense of imagination which made me feel like he was with me in the new city I lived in, and the discrepancy between our dealing with distance cost us our story. Ever since our breakup 4 months ago, my life has been nothing but a nightmarish roller coaster which does not provide any fun at all. The worse in that is that I know that he will not be willing to try again for as long as I am in that state (which no one would, this is the healthy logical thing to do), and I do not know how to get out of that state without him.It is not that I need his help to get better, but rather that our being apart hurts way too much. And now that my grandad is about to die, I am seriously wondering how I will not go even more berserk and completely ruin my last chances of getting back with him. I am seeing therapists, taking meds, doing the things that I love (activism, reading, writing and drawing, playing music), seeing my friends and family and even opening up to new relationships and flirting with cute guys.

"How to manage health anxiety when awaiting results. I have had health anxiety most of my adult life, it comes and goes, changes depending on my life stresses and what is happening.

I went for my annual skin check, and the dermatologist pointed out a mark on my face she wanted biopsied. Apparently the doctor the year before told me to get it biopsied, but I didn't book a follow up appointment.

So I had it biopsied yesterday, and the Dr wrote path report BCC? (Basel cell carsinoma).

tw for self harm abuse and suicide for the past year i ve suffered with severe depression from family genetics and other issue a a young kid death wasn t really my first thought it just kind of started appearing after a bit when i wa in middle school my close friend sexually assaulted and abused me for a year and a half they also psychologically manipulated me and abused me in way that i m shocked they got away with i have made around failed suicide attempt in my life time only one ha been severe enough to end up in a hospital because i told people but realistically there s several more that i should have been taken to a hospital for a they probably fucked up some stuff internally i form really strong and probably toxic bond with people to the point where if i think i will be left i try so hard to keep them around that it can be overbearing i ve gone to therapy since i wa in elementary school and i ve done dbt and cbt intensively i have definitely gotten better but the fact that any time someone leaf me i feel so distraught that killing myself feel like the only option my partner and i broke up at the end of january and it ha more or le destroyed me i lost my virginity to them and the breakup came out of the blue they said we could start talking again when they felt like it so i have left them alone i wa being weird about saying hi so i tried to do that some more and i wa feeling better about moving on and staying friend in the future i really haven t been feeling better i still wanted to die but i wa managing it pretty well on monday at midnight they sent a text saying they wanted to give me closure and that they never actually wanted any sort of relationship after and oops sorry about the confusion i m not sure why they sent that we haven t spoken in almost month there ha been no communication and i only told two people how i wa secretly hoping thing could be patched up everyone else who asked i had just said hopefully we can remain friend in the future i know not everyone want to stay friend but they were the one who proposed it that sent me on a spiral i broke month of self harm ripped off my fingernail in stress and haven t eaten correctly since realistically if this is going to be my response to every breakup or conflict how can i keep living like this i don t want to end my own life since a th failed attempt would be embarrassing but i also don t want to be here anymore everyone tell me that in a few month i get to move to my dream town so it ll be fine but really i don t care about that i can t handle the pain now and knowing i ll have to have it possibly many more time is excruciating i feel like i could have been a success story but realistically if it s been so long and i ve only barely gotten better then what s the point i m trying my hardest to find reason to live right now but i don t have much to care about,Depression

"The older I get all I can do is laugh at the sheer absurdity of life. I wake up, eat breakfast, work a soul crushing job for 10-12 hours, go home, eat dinner, shower, sleep, and do it all over again. I am supposed to be grateful for what I have, but I am not. I hate nearly every detail of my life. I want to make changes, but that seems like an insurmountable task. I have shut myself off from everyone except for my SO, but I have been keeping them at arms length too. I will not let anyone get close enough to see just how knackered I am by life. The numbness I feel is only topped by the bitterness that caused it. When my fractured mental state is on the verge of collapse I just start laughing uncontrollably. I see now that none of it matters, I am just another grunt trying to make enough money to survive. If anything happens to me, only a few will be affected. I have suicidal thoughts, not tendencies, at least not yet. I think of death almost non-stop. I welcome the idea of dying almost every waking moment, try to keep myself distracted from it, not always successful. I honestly think I died 10 years ago and have been stuck in limbo, would certainly explain the absurdity of the last 10 or so years. But if that is not true then I must be insane or delusional at the very least. I go down that rabbit hole on a near daily basis. I am not even sure I want life to be real anymore. Maybe I am just trapped in someone is imagination or vivid dreams. What is real life, how do I return to it, or do I stay trapped in this cycle of trying to break free of some self imposed prison for mistakes I made years ago. I cannot always distinguish fact from fiction, but I also feel like I am just punishing myself. Pushing my mental state further and further down into the abyss. My moments of clarity shine through and I see how silly and trivial it all is, but then I slip right back into this farce of an existence afterwards. Life seems like a sick joke",Depression

"Self-Fulfilling Prophesy: *The sociopsychological phenomenon of someone ""predicting"" or expecting something, and this ""prediction"" or expectation coming true simply because the person believes it will and the person's resulting behaviors align to fulfill the belief.*I have a lot of anxiety about the upcoming immigration to from Russia to Israel, where my parents live now, and I have been feeling afraid that I would be denied entry after I have done all the work they asked. I have been chatting about it with my gaming friends for a while, which would calm the nerves a bit. But I have been feeling angry at my gaming friends today. We used to be tight when I was in the you.S. being in the same time zone made it easier to play games together than it does now. Our little group helped us get through the pandemic, as we would get online every night and play PUBG, Apex, Destiny, and many other games we tried over the year. And our little group grew - first it was just the three of us, now it is seven. We also knew most of each other IRL, so we would hang out at a bar or play D&amp;D together.When I moved back to Russia in April, I used to ask them every day if they will be on, because I have got no other socializing going on for me except for family. Every day I would wake up at 7 AM on my time just to speak with my friends. I would spend a couple of hours with them, before they would peel off to sleep, and then spend the rest of the day anxious about immigration.But as the time went on, I started to get less and less responses. I would ask in our chat if people were planning to be online in the evening while it was still morning over there, just to make sure that everyone got to reply. Also, so I would get ample time to see their answers, to know when I should wake up. Initially I would get many confirmations, then less and less, then people stopped answering consistently. Eventually I would feel lucky if I got so much as a no. The distance separated us. Over time they have become busier with jobs picking up after COVID mandates lifted, with new partners, just life. I however, regressed: I am alone (or more accurately, feeling alone), I got no job, I separated with a girlfriend of 7 years, because the distance and the uncertainty of whether I am coming back to America and when, made our relationship impossible. Chronic depression became more consistent. I started to realize that I was angry at them for moving on, for finding people closer to them to spend time around, for hanging out together without me. I started blaming myself for feeling angry and upset that I was not getting the socializing I needed. I have had my depressive episodes and they have offered support over chat, which was a nice gesture. But I realized that I was angry because they said, They were there for me, except the times when I needed them. I cannot blame them for not noticing that me asking if people are online in the evening is a cry for help. That I am desperate for human contact other than my family members that I am forced to live with because I have nothing else in Russia. That I feel alone in a crowded room.I feel lonely. I feel unwanted. I feel unattractive. I feel like I am nobody. I feel like I have got nothing to offer. I feel let down because I have let myself down.I had a dream about living in the you.S. till the day I die.I LOVED living in the you.S.I feel like I have let myself down because I had not fought harder for my right to be there. Because I have not explored more options for stay. Because I did not participate in the Green Card lottery consistently. Because I did not save money to go to Grad School. Because I did not confront the Executive Director of the facility I worked at as a Counselor when he denied my request for a work visa, which they did sponsor for past employees.During these 8 years I have learned the language almost to perfection, I got a college degree, I have worked, I have got a B.A. in Psychology, I worked again, I asked, politely to let me work longer. I did everything right. And it was still not enough.In my academic life I have felt like I was barely passing, that I was procrastinating and not doing enough. I feel like I do not deserve both of my degrees. In my work life I feel that I was lucky I got my job and that I did not deserve it. That I was not doing more than I possibly could, even though some days I would work for 15 hours straight during a pandemic, ears red from the facemask loops, then falling into my bed half-dead, after driving home for an hour, so that I could be up in another two to do it all over again.And still I feel let down because I believe I let myself get kicked out of the you.S.And now I sit in the apartment in Russia, struggling to send out the paperwork for the Israeli immigration, because I am afraid, I am going to fail at that too. I choose not to act because I do not want to disappoint myself again. And it will come true, because knowing all of this is not enough motivation for me to do something about it.So, all I got left is the feeling of anger at the people who cannot play with me no more.

Should I be worried about hickeys? Hi I’m already anxious about some things but now I’m really anxious because I got a few hickeys last night and one of them is really long and runs for about 2-3 inches down my neck. I read an article about two people who died from a blood clot that came from a hickey and I’m worried that because this one is so long that will happen to me too. They seem so innocent like just bruises but I’m freaking out. Does anyone know anything or should I be worried ,Anxiety

"Side effects from taking my adderall in the morning and drinking alcohol in the afternoon around 3pm? ive been on vacation in the bahamas since march 31st til yesterday april 8th. Everyday we were super active always going out on the boat in the sun all day. On April 7th i took 20mg of adderall 3 times that day spread out between 2hrs each dose. So all together that day i had 60mg.and about an hour and a half later of my last dose i drank two rum punches throughout 3 hours time. After that about 2 and a half hours later i had 2 other rum punches again in a spand of 1 and a half hours. I never got drunk just felt pretty tipsy and good. I went to bed around 10:30pm feeling fine, not drunk at all. I woke up around 1230am with heavy vertigo and my stomach started hurting i went back to sleep hoping i would feel better in the morning. Well i woke up around 7am to get ready to leave for our flight and the vertigo was back and the stomach pain. I only puked twice i felt better after i got home in florida around 4pm i was 80% back to normal.

"Feeling as blue as the planet is warm TW CLIMATE CHANGE

I am 22 yo and I've been studying to become a lawyer for the past 6 years.

I'm on the verge of finishing my studies and I ask myself: what's the point?

How are we supposed to keep living as if things were normal, as if Society was not rushing towards a brick wall?

I've been worried about the environment for years, especially feeling helpless and seeing governments and multinationals not giving a damn.

In order not to be crushed with worry, I held onto the idea that, at worse, our generation would be okay and it's the next one which would suffer the big consequences.

In reality, it's hard to be that optimistic, especially as IPCC reports get more serious and worrying every time they're issued.

The idea that Society is on the verge of collapse feels more realistic as time goes by. I'm scared that it will not be able to adapt to climate change, that we will die or live in a post-apocalyptic world.

I'm scared and I feel helpless, especially as a future lawyer because I don't see the use in lawyers in such a situation. I'm feeling depressed because I feel like my studies are pointless. I don't see how lawyers can be useful to save the world. 

I feel like it's too late for lawyers to be helpful in urgent times, as law is such a slow process. I feel like what we need are people in the field; scientists, real politicians, essential jobs, etc.

"Rant, I Guess. Hello, sorry this is my first time actually posting on Reddit so I'm feeling a little nervous, but it's all good.

I'm a freshman in college, and last October I finally saw a psychiatrist after years of struggling and got diagnosed with Bipolar 2, GAD, panic disorder and social anxiety. We decided to try lithium and two other anxiety meds. I actually overdosed on the anxiety meds although I was taking the amount I was told and was having a lot of pain for like a few weeks, so I wasn't really able to focus in my classes; I got pretty behind and almost left on med leave. I'm now on Gabapentin and got started on Lamotrigine.

I guess the lithium was working for a while, but lately I have felt like an absolute mess. I will be in what feels like hypomania in the morning and be running around, talking a mile a minute, everything, and then just get hit with depression and withdraw from everyone. Or vice versa. And this sometimes happens multiple times a day. I'm starting to feel crazy and it is taking everything that I have to just barely function, nevermind actually having time to do homework or other responsibilities. I don't know what to do with myself. 

I just feel so terrible. It just feels like I can't achieve any sort of sane moment because if I'm not being affected by my BD, my anxiety is at a 10. I just want to be calm and stable. 

I am just afraid of this starting to affect my family and my boyfriend. He is the most understanding person I have ever met, but I feel like eventually, he is going to get exhausted with me. I'm not a very happy person and I don't understand why anyone would want to spend time with me.

I don't know anyone around here with BD and it is making me feel really alone, which is why I guess I decided to make this post. I just feel so crazy, I don't know. I'm sorry.

"I am not shure if this is the right sub for this but i have to write this down somewhere.I am a 18 year old male avererage reddit user from Germany.About a year ago I wanted to upgrade my Pc and accidently broke it. The problem in having summer vacation, close to no friends and being unable to do your two only hobbies is you have time to think, A LOT of time to think. After about two weeks of doing nothing except of thinking about my past actions and reflecting about my current state of having about 1-2 friends (ig I am still not shure what a friend really is, where do you draw the line?), severly performing under my possibilities and nearly failing my Abitur (Highschool) my mood went downwards fast. After 4 weeks when I finally got my parts to fix the PC the damage was already done. On a daily basis my mood got worse, over time I enjoyed my hobbies less and less, got less talk active (which you can see on this post I usually do a lot) and ate less and less to the point of loosing about 10kg in one week (which is unhealthy but I am overweight so its not that big of a deal) because everything tasted bland anyways and I felt empty anyways. I noticed early where that is going to go but was shure after the last/final school trip in which i had basically a breakdown once a day. I kept going anyways because I did not want anyone to worry but at the same time I wanted exactly that I wanted to see that people actually care about me, not because they had to because they are related or care about everyone, I wanted to see if somebody actually noticed that I am not okay and not just moody. Spoiler: nobody did, apart from maybe my teacher that noticed that i basically went from the most active student in the course to the least active. I cried almost every day. Nobody noticed my mom just thought i wanted to loose weight. My 18th birthday was about that time, I wanted to skip it both my parents (divorced) did not allow it. So i had two partys one with my mom, my aunt and my best friend and one with my dad, gradparents, brother, and my dads patchwork family. Both were stressing me out strongly, all human interaction was hard, I wanted to appear kind of ok even though the suicidal thoughts slowly crawled in my head more and more. I still hoped anybody notices. A few weeks later i was so instable that a simple test in school basically broke me to the point of not even being able to uphold my facade in school. that is where I drew the line, I cannot wait anymore for somebody to help, if I will not help myself now I would possibly do something really stupid later. I went to my doctor. I expected to get told I was overreacting and should calm down. My doctor took me very serious, he calmed me down took some test to check if there was a non hormonal because and prescribed me antidepressants and wrote me sick for the day and tge day after (it was thursday and the second lockdown was the week after anyways). That day was the worst, i basically had to tell my mostly oblivious relatives that I was depressed and i had to decide if I would actually use the drugs I had gotten. After talking with my parents and people I knew I came to the conclusion that I have no real alternativ than taking them. I found a psychologist about 1-2months later way faster than I expected. After about half a year of sucessful medication and therapy my psychologist said they are thinking I would not need therapy anymore, I agreed. I talked to my doctor and quit the meds. I finished school with a grade better than expected. I thought it was over it.But the whole time I knew the only goal I had in finding somebody who cared was unfulfilled. I have not found one person that cared about me, I had to get myself out of there even though that was the only thing i wanted not to do. It haunts me. I had two medium breakdowns this week. I am am fucking scared. I do not want to be depressed again, I cannot go through that shit again. I do not know what to do anymore. Everything turned out fine why am I going down the same fucking road i went about a year ago? Why do I feel like I am not even worth getting cared about?

"[Trigger heavy, i guess]Depression is back again. And i'm scared. I was doing so well. I got back to school. Life was going fine.

I wasted 6 years doing nothing because my mental health always gets in the way and *DESTROYS* everything.

But out of nowhere it all comes back again. School is getting harder day by day. The first hint of melancholy has transformed into a cold apathy and desire of self destruction.

I cannot handle failure this time. Not again.

I usually don't self harm because i really dislike self inflicted pain even though i am a masochistic by nature but i still managed to stab straight into my cephalic vein just so i could bleed.

This is not me. But i never know at what state my mood is in before it is all too late. I feel the ""same"" as always. But all the signs are there.

The spark, happiness and light is gone and now i just feel this disgust. This is the darkest and most ominous my depression has ever felt even if it isn't the most severe it has been.

I want to rip out my guts. Bleed out all my blood. Set myself on fire. Just purely *destroy* myself.

This can't go on. I can still prevent this from getting worse but i don't know who to reach out to or even that should i. Everyone is too scary. I feel like i just need to hide and wait for this to pass instead of getting into trouble by talking to people.

Sorry if my text is a bit incoherent or rambly. I don't even want to think about these things much less write about them and it makes my brain go fucking haywire.

"During high school I would cry pretty much every single day when I got back home. I was going through horrible low moods, my sleep schedule was incredibly messed up and I would just want to sleep and stay in bed when possible. I had no drive or motivation for anything, but I just continued with the routine of daily life and what is expected of a high school student. At the time I did not really realise I was depressed, I thought it was just a rough patch that would hopefully stop one day. I knew I was exhibiting symptoms of depression but I never really thought this is depression and I am depressed as though there were something wrong with me mentally, and that it all lied with me as an individual and my character.I then got into University and hoped for a fresh start. I had a decent time there and socially had no problems, but I myself as an individual was still pretty much depressed and struggled academically. This significantly increased my stress and at times my depression and throughout University, I never really had the opportunity to have a pure break because I would have to study throughout the holidays. Whilst I had multiple break downs throughout, I do not think it was as bad as during school.Done with University and back with my family, because I wanted to take a small break from everything. I used to have a lot of problems with my parents, particularly with my mother and my moving back was most probably not best for my mental health. Again, almost like at school, I would cry quite regularly and feel incredibly low with no drive or motivation. Went through two years of horrible fights with them but ultimately, I believe I have finally managed to patch things up with my mother. We most probably have the best relationship right now than we have had for the past 10 years. At that time, I realised that I have been pretty much depressed since high school, driven by my relationship with my parents. I still hold negative feelings towards them sometimes, but we r both working to being better with each other. I got back to University but still am with my family. With the pandemic, I am stuck at home most of the time. I am extremely introverted and honestly relish the time where I am completely alone. However, being at home with studies and my family has been quite stressful and throughout the past year, the stress has been continuously building up. My parents mental health had also been struggling with the pandemic and as I have pretty much since I was a kid, I would support them a lot during these times. This also subtly contributed to my stress. I had not managed to have an actual break, (though I do have long periods of stress induced procrastination) and eventually I messed something up a month ago and had a horrible break down, like the ones I had during the worst of my times back during my old University or school years. I felt like this time, I ridiculously felt the physical effects of stress and depression, and really felt like they could kill me. For what has been pretty much a decade of depression, bad sleep and poor coping skills with stress, I have experienced physical symptoms like pain. But right now, I feel like its all building up to the point of boiling over (or it already has). I am repeating the same cycle of procrastination, self hate, not recovering from feeling horrible and stressed, even though I really do try to go to sleep earlier or exercise/go out for walks. I really do not need to socialise with people and I do maintain decent contact with my friends. I feel depressed pretty much 24/7 when I am not distracting myself with music, media entertainment, socialising. I cannot focus on my studies at all and I am just so tired. I have been tired for a decade and I just do not know what to do anymore. I always tell myself that one day it just will not be like this, but I am exhausted, drained and no matter how much I rest I just feel horrible. I do not know what to do anymore.

"If you read the title read it once again.What I am saying below is depressing but it is not a lie.Does anyone feel like they are never living in the present, I sure do. I live my life chasing hopes and solving problems I have mostly caused myself, trying to better myself everyday and becoming someone I should be in my own mind. But there is always that thought that everything could end in a matter of seconds and I know that is very possible to happen.So that leaves me with this mission I feel I will never solve, if I am chasing all these dreams and always trying to become someone I want to be. What does that make of myself today. Would I ever be at peace in death if it were to happen today? Or would i be on my mission still, trying to become the perfect version of my self which in my head has existed many times. But yet I would always judge my own thoughts and feel like I should do 'better' even when I have reached a goal that I once visioned to be the perfect me.I chase and I chase, I feel purpose in being something more than I am every single day, I tell myself I am not happy or i will never be at peace until I fulfil these visions. But each vision I see and claim I still feel the fucking same way, one thing ends and its on to the next to fulfil myself as the last vision was nothing more than a stepping stone in my own mind. It leaves me with the question that has surfaced during every vision I have ever had and that is would I be happy if I were to die today? Or would I be worthless as I never took the steps I told myself to do. Ill be fucking honest if you have related to what I just said it can only end one way, that way I have figured out today. The way it ends is in helpless hope for happiness and fulfilment, to reach the perfect version of yourself to be someone that you have dreamt of which will only be a fragment of the life you once lived, nothing more than energy from your own mind. Nothing to anyone else, nothing to yourself. Sure as hell nothing to the future of this world. We are here because we were born to be, lead upon a life of confusion and misled instructions. To be a 'human' the only species that could ever think and do for themselves as far as we know. Alone on this world and on a mission to become a superior race. To dominate this earth to conquer our solar systems. To become gods at the end of it all as far as I know in my own head.But that will not happen for a very long fucking time, all we are today is hurdles, paths forged by our own thoughts to lead us hopefully to a blissful fairytale of immortality, where we could all live with our loved ones and remember the best times of our lives for an eternity.The problem with that is that we are never living our best times because we are chasing and chasing our better selves to bring peace. Which is ultimately pain in the end.So to end all of this my final mission is to tell all of you that life is nothing, nothing more than a figment of your mind, nothing more than fake instructions to be what you are. At the end of everything you are alone, lifeless and empty, nothing more than a past present to the future and what will the future be? The same fucking same thing.We are all here to live and die. Everything single thing along the way may bring the slightest and I mean slighted change to the future of life. The rest of it is just a delusional thought you have created to feel some sort of peace in your life until you reach the end where you hope, hope to be in a fucking dream world Knowing all this makes me feel numb, worthless and non existent and if you have related to what I just said you would feel the same. But that is very likely to be what this life is. There is nothing else along the way other than false hopes and sad endings, I am sorry for myself for having to be here and I am sorry for everyone else that is on the same ride with me. We wish we were more but that is beyond us. This is the dark truth of the world. It revolves around energy and we are just feeding it until it ends its own fate.So enjoy the ride, fulfil every hope you have and never stop doing so as I am sure it will make this easier. If you cannot stop changing yourself the world will simply do that for you. Which is being in death before you are dead. The way I feel about life. (I will warn you this post is not going to be a happy ending)",Depression

"Bone tumor I had been doing so well for a couple years up until recently. I've got a bony lump growing on my sternum over the last two months, with pain being present for the past 1.5 months. I had an x-ray, blood test, and CT scan. The lump is undoubtably growing and the pain is still there. All the scans and the blood test came back fine, the radiologist just noted a ""sternal notch"" and everything else was fine, there were no suggestions as to what it is or anything. 

My university doctor doesn't seem to know what it is and just said ""you may be producing extra cartilage right now. It might be one of these things where you'll have to wait up to 6-8 months for the pain to go away."" How is the pain supposed to go away if this bony lump is still growing and likely won't disappear without surgery?

I feel better with the radiologist not being suspicious of the lump, but I still feel uncomfortable because no one knows what it is yet and I feel like bone cancer is still kind of in the picture. My sternum/sternal joint pain is still here and it has been 1.5 months. I'm making an appointment with my real doctor back home to try and nail this shit down.

"Wondering if I could be bipolar So when I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago my doctor told me to watch for any mania because of my family history with bipolar. I hadn’t had any issues until this year. I’ve always been moody and could change at the drop of a hat. But I never considered that abnormal for me.
I had one experience a few weeks ago where I felt I could have been manic. I was at work and just in a great mood, nothing could shake me, overly peppy and talkative. I couldn’t focus very well, my mind was just jumping from thing to thing. My boyfriend who works with me pointed out that I wasn’t acting normal after I had already kind of noticed the elevated mood myself. I was trying not to fixate on it but once he pointed it out it started making me very anxious. 
Since then I’ve been keeping track of my moods with an app because my boyfriend also pointed out that it’s not the only time I’ve acted odd and I sometimes don’t notice it at all. 
I just started seeing a therapist and when I brought this up to her she told me the feeling has to last days to be mania. From what I’ve read hypomania doesn’t have to be long lasting.

"Just venting Wanna preface this by saying that I'm not diagnosed nor do I self-diagnose. It's just that I can relate to some of the symptoms and people here, and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings.

I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic, paranoid, insecure, and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me, I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while, but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.

I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my ""trauma"" is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular, there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did, but they felt really, sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself, and nobody did for me.

This person lashed out at me, calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times, and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and, honestly, that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.

This person wasn't wrong, but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak, because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back, it felt nasty and unwarranted.

Still though, it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends, a few years since those bad exchanges occured, and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life, seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my self-esteem and it still does.

When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like ""I wanna die"" to myself, like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more ""normal"" again though.

Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not, sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered off-topic since I'm undiagnosed. But yeah, I feel really pathetic about this side of myself. Maybe I'm just highly neurotic, I don't know. I just wish I could understand what's wrong with me.",Personality disorder

It made the highs feel better.But for a few months now, I have been, by most views, improving. I have less depressive episodes. It went from 3 weeks to 5 to 8. The sadness behind the self-harm is fading, and as it does, the strength of temptations grows weaker.And yet, I cling to what remains. I am not ready to get better. I am not ready to lose the comfort of harming. The depression is part of who I am at this point, and I do not know how to live without it. Perhaps because my depression never had a clear because, there is no closure, nothing in my life has improved to justify or explain me getting better.I am here because my partner suggested I ask if anyone else has experience with this. I am not really sure how much you all will know of this, but its worth a shot. Thank you in advance. I am getting better, and I hate it.",Depression

"Helpful starter links for dealing with Health Anxiety **EDIT: I have found all the modules, a long with the parent link. I have now included all of them for you :)**

I, like many of you, have been dealing with debilitating health anxiety - specifically, concerning me focusing on my stomach, kidneys and waste (literally examining every urine and bowel movement).  I have been to the doctor 3 times already, have done 2x blood tests and a stool test, and everything came back okay, yet I am still unconvinced, a feeling I'm sure many of you can relate to.

&amp;nbsp;

So tonight (since it's a Sunday and I can't call my doctor yet again :p), I decided to look for some self help. Through a google search I came across these .pdfs that have already brought some comfort to me, in the short few minutes I've been working with them.  Apparently, there are 9 modules, but I have only been able to locate modules 1-3, 6, and 8-9 (missing 4, 5, and 7).  I am going to keep searching for the rest of them, in an attempt to maximize the effectiveness, but for now, I'd figure I'd share these with you, friends.  Hopefully they help to bring some comfort to you.

Im tired of crying myself to sleep and having no one to talk to about this. They see me happy one day and the following they try list all my triggers.

But again she is a child so i know i cannot burden her with these thoughts. And she cannot become the people i need her to be and her words are starting to sound like whispers compared to the screaming pain.

I tend to my son every needs, I play, I read, I take him on walks and when he goes to bed around 7/8 I go to bed too, and I am asleep by 10.I am currently on sick leave due to PTSD, I stayed home with my son till march, and now I have 6 hours all alone every day except the weekends.

"DVT Anxiety Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

So starting Monday morning my right leg (thigh just above the ankle) started to hurt in a weird mix of a cramp and DOMS like way. The pain didn't go away for three days now and yesterday when examining it with my gf my leg has also swollen and became tender at the area where the pain comes from.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I went to my GP who measured my legs, and examined them with her hands. She said she doesn't think it is a vein issue just a pulled or twisted muscle, so I should just rest and take over the counter muscle relaxing meds. I told her that I did not do anything particularly active over the weekend (just sleeping and playing video games pretty much), she still said that I could have just strained a muscle while sleeping and it might keep on hurting for 1-2 weeks even. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still very worried and anxious as DVT is often misdiagnosed and people even die after being sent home thinking that it is just a muscle strain. My leg still hurts with no improvement whatsoever (maybe even getting a bit worse, although that might just be my brain), it is swollen in one area, but I am not feeling extra warmth and there is no discoloration.

"I have been very active here recently but having somewhere to vent, somewhere where I do not feel alone makes the feeling alot easier on me I guess. This is not entirely related to the post, I just wanted to express my appreciation for this subreddit. Its helped me alot.That being said I just saw a post on here, someone talking about being ""snapped out of it"" because they realized how much it would hurt their kid and it made me think about why I have not done it yet.My two brothers. One older than me and one younger than me. The older one tells me all the time that when I was born it snapped him out of suicide. His attempts were stopped by me crying as a baby, or even when I annoyed him he still loved me and wanted to stick around to see me happy or even just to annoy me. My younger brother has never expressed the desire to kill himself to me before, like I did to my older brother brother; but I have similar reasons. Truthfully, I like to fuck with him. Sometimes the funniest part of my day is me walking into his room, flicking his forehead and walking out. he is one of the funniest people I know and I know my death would ruin him. I have two sisters, neither if them are super in my life so I do not know for sure how my death would impact them but it helps to think they would be devastated too. I have a niece. she is a year and 7 months old and she is the cutest thing to exist. She cannot talk but I love my moments of communication with her. We play games together even though she cannot speak. Some sort of variation of simon says where she waves her arms and claps her hands wanting me to copy her. Sometimes she will turn of the tv when I am watching and look at me and laugh at me. Sometimes she does things and when I tell her to stop she looks at me and does it anyway. I want to see her grow up. she is so smart right now and I love how she is right now and I want to see her get older and I want to tell her stories about right now and show her videos of how she liked to just fuck with her aunt or how she would kiss her reflection.Sometimes this does not work. Sometimes I relish in the feeling that if I did commit suicide right now, people would be devastated. Sometimes I feel like that is the only time I will be loved by everyone unconditionally, and I feel like at my funeral, when it finally sets in, everyone will realize what they did wrong and feel remorse. Sometimes I think that if I died right now maybe in the afterlife I will have everything I want, including what makes me happy now. Maybe if I just did it I could have my cake and eat it too.This is a hard reason to have, because sometimes its my reason for wanting to kill myself and sometimes its my reason for staying alive. I want a better reason. I wish this was not my only reason but its kept me here for 9 years. Maybe if I had a better reason, the 9 years would finally be over and I could just live and be happy but for now I guess it will do.

I heard that this business has been running for 4-5 years now but from what I seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do as they have tutoring, selling board games/blind boxes and even large figurine tradings, throwing menial tasks at every employee with focus on trying to get more employees to join. I worked around 11-12 hours on average so it makes me stressed at first.

Then a few days ago when I got home from work (around 11pm almost midnight) my dad called me in to have a talk with him, then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. At first I didn't think about it much. Me and my father didn't go well for a long time so I think of it more as of a warning, however it turned to make me angry and stressed as he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if I were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all, with me still able to talk. I got so stressed and tired enough that I didn't get enough sleep after I finally got to excuse myself.

And comes up to today as I had enough with today as I tend after their store and I was a little loopy, I looked like I was sleeping when I'm actually trying to stay awake. The owner called me that he's been watching me sleeping for 15 minutes and he's going to cut my pay. Then he ordered me to go to wash my face. i did before coming back, so angry and annoyed that I slapped the store's security camera, HARD. Luckily it didn't break just the camera cable disconnected so it's an easy fix. So I just called the manager and told them that the camera accidentally fell to the ground and broke, saying that it worked fine after I reassembled it. I was a little panicked but a little less stressful from that.

Sorry it's more of a rant post, but I do need help managing my own stress and it just came up almost everyday. How do I do it? I felt like I could explode at any point right now.",Stress

"This is literally the first time I am opening up somewhere, and not denying my miserable mental health. I am a 19 year old teen, and went through a painful breakup 11 months ago. I was completely fine and confident before that - a nice social group of friends that I made almost everywhere I went. People used to compliment me for my good looks and charm and it made me more confident. However after the breakup things started going downhill. I am not sure if it is the lockdown and quarantine that made me this way.I literally hate meeting people now. People give me anxiety. I force myself to attend meetup plans made by some 4-5 friends that are left. I feel tired to pick up calls from friends, my phone stays on silent all the time. I do not open social media at all and even if I do, all the messages I get are left unanswered. I cannot even do daily chores which involve interacting with people like going to the shop to buy groceries or visiting the barber. Somehow, I push myself to do it. I want to join the gym and start working out again but I am afraid of all the other people at the gym. I am well over my ex girlfriend and do not feel anything about her or the breakup. But , I do refrain from meeting our old mutual friends. My sleep schedule is messed up, I sleep at 1:30 am and wake up at 10:30 am. Previously, I was diagnosed with migraine. Now that I stay at home all day I do not get them. But socialising or going out gives me stress migraines. I know this is not normal and I want to get out of all this. This is a genuine cry for help.

"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for 10 years. For the most part I managed it, and I had a decent life and support system. But the past few years everything in my life has gone completely downhill. Its been one thing after another, and just when I think it cannot get any worse, it does. It started when I began to get panic attacks every day, and my social anxiety took a deep dive in college. I dropped out, and have only managed a few classes since then. My mom started having vision problems 3 years ago due to a negligent doctor that failed to inform her that the corneal disease she is had since a teen was rapidly progressing. I have watched her go to all these top specialists week after week for 3 years, and every treatment option has failed. she is always been my best friend and my rock. Watching her go through this, unable to do anything has been horrible. But recently, her mental health took a big turn for the worse. I have had to call 911 on her twice to get her to a psych hospital in the past 3 months. she is truly the only person I have left though. 2 of my closest family members died unexpectedly, the rest of my family does not give a fuck despite my efforts to reach out, my dad is the worst of them all, and I have lost all my friends. I am absolutely terrified for my mom, and I wish so bad I could do something to actually help her. But selfishly, my mental health is at an all time worse. I have never felt more alone and scared in my life, I think about suicide every minute, and I have come up with a plan. I am 23 with no college degree, barely any work history, with no hope for an actual future. I have lost the one person I could got to about anything, because I cannot burden my mom with everything she is going through. I see a therapist every week and it has been zero help. She recommended a residential therapy program for a month, which I feel like is worth a try but the problem is I cannot leave my mom. She has enough vision to do basic things, but she cannot drive, and she needs me right now. No one else in our family understands or cares enough to even call her. I feel so trapped, so hopeless, so terrified. I know that makes me a selfish person, I know I need to suck it up and help my mom. But fuck I do not know how I can keep going like this.

"Recent Bipolar II diagnosis. Scared and confused. Off the bat, I'm an alcoholic who has been trying (mostly unsuccessfully) to stop drinking for a while. 

Went to a 10-day detox in January. I thought I could dry out and get back into the groove that was my 6 months of clean time. But instead, I relapsed a week out. Spent the most of February bunny hopping - few days drinking, few days drying out - and realized that I had to get my ass back to rehab.

So here I am; 4th rehab in 3 years. I've been to this one twice before, I guess 3 times if you count my short stint in their detox a few weeks back. Most of the time, I get sober for 6 months and relapse +/- 7 days. 

The psychiatrist who has been seeing me whenever I end up back here diagnosed me with Bipolar II yesterday. And I feel weird about it. 

Which brings me here. I don't know what to do next. 

I don't know if I should get a second opinion or just accept this one; we've met about 4 times this year alone for 1+ hours each time, and like I said he's the same psychiatrist who has done all of my evaluations here over the years. He would like to put me on Lamictal.",Bipolar

"tw for mention of sexual assaulthi all, I am 18 and i have schizoaffective-bipolar disease, currently unmedicated. things have been going okay for me the past few months generally until last month i got into some shit.in early May, i cut off my ex and the friend group that was associated with them because i felt that their lifestyle (constantly doing drugs with no ambitions) was detrimental to me, in addition to just feeling uncomfortable around my ex like that. we dated from January 2020 to June 2020 and we had hooked up a couple times after that earlier this year.a little bit after that happened, they started spreading allegations that i sexually assaulted my ex, or more specifically that i pressured them into giving consent. i really do not know how that happened, i tried to do everything i could to make them comfortable i asked multiple times beforehand, checked in during, and made sure they felt comfortable about all of it afterwards. i was absolutely blindsided by all of this and i still have no idea what happened. i reached out to my ex a couple times asking what happened, if i can help make amends, etc. but i never got a response i was specifically told by one of those ex-friends to leave them alone. (interestingly, said friend is the only person who has been spreading these allegations, though they are clearly still close with my ex).which i guess brings me here. i feel like the worst person in the world over a situation where i do not even know what i did wrong or how i can make amends. i feel like i truly do not deserve to live i feel like if i killed myself it would give everyone some closure.

"Currently going through a rough patch again. Had half of a ""falling out"" situation with my parents recently. Relationship with my (bipolar) girlfriend is on a mutually imposed hiatus because she wants to be alone a lot lately having started a new job after being out of work for over a year and a half needing to adjust I guess and me being someone that enjoys and needs affection. And two days ago my car broke down. Just came home from my work summer event (professional life is going great actually but atm I feel like I am just functioning). Came home and immediately grabbed my guitar and started playing and singing my soul out to the song ""Dead Flowers"" by the Rolling Stones (playing the Townes Van Zandt version). And then it happened. A genuine flashback. 4 years ago I was on a kind of soul searching trip in Vietnam. Sitting on a Rooftop in Hanoi I played guitar and sang by myself and this girl was watching me and after a brief moment of silence she looked me dead in the eye and said ""You sing when you are sad, do not you?"" And it hit me like a truck. I do not know why I am even posting this on here. I guess I juest need to vent. I really really hope that our hiatus will work out. I still do not know how I will get through the next 4 weeks but I will manage somehow because she is worth it to me... we have been really good friends on a deep level for years and our relationship just started in February of this year. At the start of this year everything was going so well. I was out of therapy and started a new career path in IT and then ""we"" happened. And now it feels like everything is falling apart. I just hope I will have the strength to carry on. Because at the moment that is the only thing left for me to do. Again I do not know why I am posting this here.

"I am frustrated. that is the constant theme with my life. I just turned 30 last month and never really even wanted to make it that far in this state of mediocrity. My stepdad broke me as a person growing up. I am frankly terrified of men, especially loud obnoxious southern men like him who seem to all spout out endless streams of racist hate and blind adherence to tradition. he is the exact definition of the type of person I hate most and I see him in seemingly every man I have to interact with. And as a man, I am expected to be the same. And I am terrified of standing up to them all so I just stay quiet. I am just as much to blame as they are for so much that is wrong in the world because I am so chickenshit I cannot call them out when they are wrong.I spent between the ages of 17-23 absorbed in a religious phase that wasted away any potential I had. I developed a passivity that still lingers to this day, although in a more secular form. I hated my life then and did not want to admit it out of some sense of guilt so I just focused every aspect of my life around anticipating death in hopes of finally getting to reach some illusionary paradise in an afterlife. I did not care about anything. I just wanted ""some job I could tolerate"" to get myself through life until I could finally die. I thought too much and read too much to put it simply and started to question how the world worked. I began to take seriously the possibility that my religion was incorrect and that there might not actually be any meaning, any purpose other than what I defined for myself. I became obsessed with trying to correct my life's trajectory, having wasted away the years I should have been using to achieve education in favor of Christian superstition I had filled my head with. I wanted to be brilliant more than anything. I wanted to try to make up for what I had lost. I tried like hell to get myself straightened out and through school but failed horribly at it. I took on a few jobs trying to pay my way through school and hated every second of them, surrounded constantly by the kind of person my stepdad was. The kind of person I am apparently supposed to be in order to be a good, god-fearing American. I spent another year trying to cling desperately to something I could live for. I got myself out of my mom's house at least so that I was finally away from her own brand of religious nonsense. I successfully got into an actual relationship for the first time in my life and basically just coasted through the next few years. I obviously could not go to school since I had fucked that up. So I just did menial work I hated and coped with life as best as I could. I could not help myself and started seriously studying on my own a couple years ago, right around the beginning of 2018. With no direction or guidance, I basically just gravitated wildly toward any philosophical topic I could find that interested me and began to seriously write in an attempt at parsing my own view of reality and my place in it, as well as where to go from there. This project continued along with my regular visits to therapy and medication that I genuinely believed helped me at the time. My counselor began to suggest I look into trying to return to school again. It was something I was afraid of, but I did start to research it and found that it was possible for me to do it. I went back to school in fall 2019 and loved it. I certainly did not feel any connection to any fellow students, but it gave me regular intellectual challenges and a sense of growth. I was not able to take as many classes in person as I would have liked to because of work, but I tried to make the most of the experience. 2020 everything went to shit for everyone it seemed, and I was no exception. I had started to develop psoriatic arthritis over the past year and this escalated to a point where I lost most of my grip strength and could barely function physically at all. Given that the only things I am qualified to do for pay involve mindlessly moving things around or doing repetitive physical tasks, I felt broken and useless at doing something I hated but had to do no matter what if I wanted to survive. I began to consider suicide for the first time in years and wound up hospitalized. I eventually lost my job in the summer and struggled until I could get some treatment for PsA. When I started infusions I felt immediate relief and regained some sense of utility as a person. I was struggling with balancing classes with the job I was able to get and I jumped around aimlessly between a few jobs. I lost the last job I had in January. I was working at a food bank/thrift store donation center and missed work so I could attend a job interview elsewhere. It was not that I hated the job, I simply hated being there and having to work for a literal church. I hated sitting in employee meetings and hearing everyone ramble about how all the problems were caused by satan and that we needed to remain strong against ""the enemy"" knowing full well that they meant people like me. Useless godless leftist scum who just get in the way. I never got the job I interviewed for and I have been jobless ever since. I lived off savings and unemployment through that time. I lost my patience with school because as always I fail at every endeavor it seems. I felt out of place trying desperately to claw my way into an academic setting I had no business being in as someone from a working class background. I have no patience for formalities, for gatekeeping, or for endless bureaucracy. I cannot fathom suffering through another 6+ years of this to hopefully stand a chance at being valued as someone worth taking seriously when I know statistically that is incredibly unlikely. I do not have contacts, I do not know anyone, I have no shortcuts I can take. I haphazardly withdrew from college in early April citing frustration with my lack of belonging in a field which is more interested in maintaining extant social institutions than upending them. As someone who actively hates society as it is, I have lost nearly all interest in attempting to stabilize it as though we need only vote for the right liberal every four years to make everything better while nothing materially changes and the rest of the world suffers for it. I phrases my withdrawal in a way which understandably appeared to indicate a threat to myself and campus police came and made me go to the ER. Another hospital stay. I have stopped talking to my girlfriend about this stuff. She does not really care or seem to understand anymore and has told me as much at times. She is comfortable with her place in the world where she can rely on the police to handle her problems for her and get rid of those pesky undesirables who make too much noise at night rather than going and having a discussion with them herself. And I am no better. They do not bother me like they seem to bother her, but I cannot shake the fear that the situation will escalate out of control.Anyway I still have no job and I have no desire to return to college, having once again wasted more years of my life. I am tired of going outside every goddamn day and being hounded by people trying to give me religious pamphlets and by my family telling my to pray and everything will get better. I just want someone to take me fucking seriously for once in my life when I beg them to stop shoving religious shit in my face. And I am too fucking cowardly to outright tell them I am an atheist. They cannot even comprehend how such a thing could be possible. It is as though Christianity is some truth embedded in nature itself. I am terrified of finding work again because my work history is terrible and I have become obsessed with the desire to live authentically, which seems impossible to reconcile with the daily process of work. I am an inconvenience on society, which would rather like to just go about their lives praying and patiently waiting for an afterlife they will never get and *insisting* that I and others do the same, going so far as to legislate their preferred world into existence. I just want to get out of everyone is way and be left alone. I am tired of hating their ignorant fucking superstitions to the point where it is exhausting and I just want to die so I can stop bothering them. I am terrified of dying because the only thing I really care about anymore are my two cats. And I do not think my girlfriend would be able to keep them since her family is allergic and I cannot stand the thought of them suffering but I cannot stand the thought of suffering myself. I am a bitter asshole and I just want to see the world look like it might someday be a tolerable place to live in, but we are just going to cook ourselves to death slowly while making a quick buck along the way. I cannot write for shit anymore. My mind is everywhere. I do not know how the fuck I can work like this and I do not even want to at all. I do not do anything but sit around playing video games these days because they give me some semblance of control over *something*. I run a D&amp;D campaign every week. And I have my cats. These are small things but they are all I have anymore. I do not think humanity is ever going to unfuck itself and I do not want to sit around watching it get worse. But I simultaneously do not want to let go of these brief, tiny pleasures. I am trying to figure out a way to just stay out of everyone is way so I can at least live out my cats' lives.

"This is just a rant. While my highs are not high, my lows and very, very low. And its creeping back in. I am unable to comprehend how random and chaotic my mind is right now. And the only way out is the easy one. How can I be the bad guy, how can she hate me more that her abuser and her molester?What burns me the most is that hes gotten away with it, now hes happy with a new born. I am sure she is forgiven him, but I know she will never stop hating me, because my existence is a reminder of the guilt and betrayal she inflicted on me. Every time she thinks about me, she cannot accept the fact that what she did was wrong. But people will defend her. She was manipulated and abused I know her well, well enough to know that even now when she touches her self she thinks about him, the memories they had, how good it felt, the rush and excitement. And deep down she does not regret it. I cannot stand the fact that in her story, the one who loved her. I am the bad guy.

"17, Need professional help but not sure if parents understand that I'm 17 and male. Since last year I've constantly thought im going to have a heart attack, cardiophobia. It's really starting to get in the way.

It takes me so long to fall asleep at night because of this, I get anxiety attacks often, and I've formed a habit where I need to knock on wood almost all the time to calm me down a bit (weird habit)  
  
I'm not overweight and I go for bike rides a lot but my dad is always telling me to workout because he loves working out. I tried it months ago but the fear I was going to have one multiplied and I couldn't stand feeling my heart beat. He's trying to have me do guided meditation but for some reason that makes me way more anxious than when I started. He hasn't wanted me to go to therapy because I haven't ""committed to his solutions yet"".   
I get and appreciate he's trying to help but I really wanted professional help. I went to them in tears a couple weeks ago saying please just let me get some professional help, and my mom said she'd find someone. Fast forward to today and I found out she got my a family psychologist, one that already sees my 10 year old brother (he gets very angry).   
I wanted an actual therapist, I'm not sure if it's the same thing and my mom is saying that ""he's just going to say the same things we've been saying and it's going to cost a lot""

"I really dont know what to do anymore For the record i am not suicidal but i do feel like i have no way out of this. I have a concerning health condition that has been neglected for the past 6 years and gradually getting worse. I am on a slow decline in health and will do a more detailed write-up of my life and issues soon. I see death as an option to free my body of its ailments and the stupidity that caused it, had i not hurt myself i would be taking a different path but im pretty much disabled now and have tried to fight the healthcare system with no diagnosis and been labelled as crazy by every person i meet. I wont sing, dance, look or feel the same way again so for me thats not worth it. I always dreamt of doing those things but now i will never be able to do them efficiently. I dont see death as a bad thing, just terrifying and really hard to process and a way to get out of a shitty life, i would rather die than be in a lot of situations really because we all die anyway i dont really want to suffer for too long. And the world doesnt care because it will just keep spinning. so there arent any negative feelings just logical and impartial situation which i accept. Everyone will die too so rather sooner than later. Otherwise I would have a degree in performing arts or music by now and would be performing and doing things with my life. Sadly that isnt the case and am stuck with an illness that isn't getting better.

My face is swollen and so is my body, my wounds won't heal, I can't exercise and feel fatigued every day, my veins bulge and I have extremely pale skin, my eyes are also bulging(my brother pointed this out to me and I thought I was the only one who thought this), my teeth are cracking and my gums are pale, numbness in every single part of my body, blood pools, anhedonia, and dissociation, impaired memory and I can't even count or decide what to eat, have to double check my spelling and memory and even then I forget, bathroom struggles, insomnia, weak bones, head feels full and swollen, fingernails have started to club believe it or not, hair and nails don't grow, blue extremities and struggling to breathe, cant hold head up and body feels very heavy to carry, sharp pains around my body aching pains, blurred vision and double vision, i can't even walk anymore and my ligaments crack all the time. pre 2017 this would not have been the case because i injured myself very severly and do not realise the damage i have done. doctors are saying nothings wrong with me but thats not true, the problems have built up over time which i suspect is a problem with my vascular system but getting seen in the UK is very hard. i have also bought a healthcare plan which is not private health insurance but all that i can afford(£11 monthly). The extent of damage it has done to me made me realize that i may not ever be normal again IF i ever get treated that is, and so i feel like my only option is to die. I know some people say that people who are crippled and have disabilities can have long satisfying lives but that is not the life for me, especially considering there was nothing wrong with me before. i always dream to be that way again but i know i won't get that anymore and i wont be happy at all, the damage it has done to me probably affected my brain to the point where i dont think it will ever recover, or my heart, or my bones, or my optic nerves so i don't think it's worth living if I have long-lasting complications.

And also the cause was self-harm, I know it sounds silly but it could have been prevented. I was mentally ill and the things I did weren't normal, looking back at it now and it's all my parent's fault, they convoluted my idea of normal since I was a little kid. I never got the help i needed not even for my selective mutism and now I'm screwed for good. I'm no good anymore and worthless, I can't even make or remember memories and this isn't the depression speaking since I had an urge to fix my life and get back on track. Now I have a wound that will never heal. My parents were extremely toxic and detrimental since my youth, my only fantasies were ones of running away. I don't have much contact with them and am stuck in the house with them. In 2017 I self-harmed so bad my left side went number and weaker and I have been that way ever since. Now it's caused so many problems because of something pressing on my vascular system causing harm to my entire body, but I am told there is nothing wrong with me, even by the most toxic people of all (my parents) they got so sick of me trying to reach out for help, my father shouted at me and sent me into a burst of tears, I choked on my tea but I persisted and called the doctor and asked for an appointment, he took me to the docs but I feel like I'm in a losing game. I don't really have any positive options anymore and am in so much pain 24/7. I've lost my sight somewhat, hearing, function, mobility, emotions, and cognition and am basically becoming a vegetable. Even if I do get treated it will be too late as the damage has left permanent wounds. I've shown someone pics before and they have admitted its pretty messed up what I have been through. I am struggling for answers but at the least, I can get a diagnosis just so I can shove it in people's faces and prove them wrong. But other than that I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I got tired from making this post I took a few breaks and am still lethargic.

My doctor that i recently visited also noticed that i was looking a bit pale so for me thats been a relief, he was quite attentive and offered to give me a blood test which is next month so i have to struggle to next month. He weighed me(im 48kg now) and we talked about my symptoms and I did mention to him it has to do with my vascular system, it's now a test of time to see what will happen. Realistically I don't think my prognosis is too good. But people are becoming more attentive to how messed up my body is so I think thats a good but far too little too late now",Depression

Its so easy with online classes to say Ill do it later, especially when they are asynchronous. Ill do it later turns into Ill do two days worth of work tomorrow and then I can catch up on everything over the weekend. Except, you never do. And then the anxiety hits, and you feel awful for not doing work, so its on your mind 24/7. But you do not actually have the motivation to go do the work, and you end up burying yourself in some instant gratification trying to hide from the anxiety and get out of actually putting effort into anything. Except, this just feeds the anxiety more, which makes you delve into more instant gratification, and the cycle repeats endlessly. This has been my life for the past year and a half. Its maddening, and I honestly regret not killing myself when I was 16. At least then I would not have to deal with this.

2 years of depersonalization/derealisation and depression and suicidal thoughts. It has not gotten better and I now hate myself and I know I will not ever like myself again. I have become a robot. I cannot even talk or look any family members in the eyes. Friends do not understand the dpdr side. It hurts because I have only opened up to two people about it who are my friends and one said he thought he had it and it was not that bad and the other asked if I am imagining it all this going on and I have to decide my future now. I am going into college in a month and have to pick a job and all. Antidepressants not working and I have gotten fat and cannot even care. Only reason I live is because if I did not it would because my family pain and I am very grateful that my family loves me even though most of them do not love eachother but I do not even deserve their love. I hate myself for past mistakes and believe I do not ever deserve love or happiness but sometimes think death is an easy way out and think maybe living and suffering would be a better punishment for me.

"I tried Omega 3 supplements and it's made a huge difference. So basically,  I did some research online on foods, medicines etc. and their relationship to bipolar disorder. I then came across a study that said that Omega 3 fatty acids help with depression in bipolar disorder and I also came across a piece that said that when post mortem are done in people with bipolar disorder they generally find levels of omega 3 in their brains less than in people without the disorder.

So I decided to give omega 3 a shot. I've been taking 1500mg daily for the past 2 months. When I started I was super depressed. It took like a week for me to begin to feel the difference. At the moment I feel quite stable and happy.

"I'm screwed, maybe many of you are too? One thing I'm aware of is after you've been disconnected from societal norms for a few years, it seems very difficult to return. I tend to stay away from looking at other people's lives, overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard you're compared against.

The average person is socially active, whereas were disengaged. They have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans, messaging circles. In a day some days I speak to no one and can't even find the motivation to do anything new, even something like watching a movie I can put off. My point is that after a while when you look at the ''activity level'' of a normal average person I just feel inadequate. This is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others I get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early I have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and I am not so much like them. And thats the catch-22 because people excluding you stops you ever having anything.

My therapist can’t see me until Thursday and my Psych doc can’t see me until next Tuesday. My antipsychotic was gone, I had been doing so good that I hadn’t used it in forever. All I have had is my usual meds, which aren’t doing anything and my lorazepam for my panic attacks.

"New diagnosis, nervous about medication Was diagnosed with BP 1, but it must be the mildest ever, based on reading posts on here. I have been taking lexapro for three years, b/c previous therapists diagnosed anxiety disorder. So currently, i have a lot of mania, but very little depression. and the mania doesn't seem too extreme - my therapist thought it was BP 2 but the psych testing came back BP 1, which she agrees with now. I have thought I was the second coming on occasions, that's probably the most manic idea i've had. I have a good career, have always done well in the workplace. I am a mom and wife, and my family loves me. So I really hesitate to medicate. But I also wonder if I should keep taking Lexapro? My therapist said withdrawl from that is ugly, so she doesn't recommend it. But maybe it's been triggering my mania? I was also diagnosed with mixed personality disorder, mainly borderline with a heavy dose of narcissism. So naturally, I am very concerned with medication that could affect my skin (already went through struggles with acne while younger, not going to do that again) and also obsess about my weight.

"I can't trust my memories I had a pretty extended hypomanic episode in Nov-Dec, and a few weeks into the episode I had a long-awaited pdoc appointment at a specialized mood disorder clinic. I came out of the appointment very upset because the doctor didn't seem to want to help me, didn't seem to get what I was saying, wanted me to stop taking the meds that had pulled me out of a year-long suicidal depression. I hadn't slept more than an hour the night before, so the appointment is a bit of a blur, but I felt betrayed by the system and cried for hours.

I saw the pdoc for a second time today and my impression of her was completely different. Apparently she is not a psycho monster bitch. She clearly wants to help me and has a reasonable approach, even if it's not what I would have chosen.

I also realized that I have gaps in my memory from that time - like I know one of my friends was concerned enough about my state of mind to call my mother - but, for example, I completely don't remember one of my friends coming over and visiting me for several hours. Granted, I was drinking a lot over that period, but not enough to completely forget events. It makes me wonder what else I'm not remembering.

I'm diagnosed BPII but I know that over about 6 weeks I spent way too much money, hardly slept (or sometimes even didn't) for days at a time, and drove so recklessly that I could have been arrested if I had been caught. I just didn't go to work a few times. Also had a few panic attacks. I had some pretty big ideas but I wasn't psychotic, so manic vs. hypomanic? Don't really know, don't really care too much, but I normally consider myself a very grounded and rational person so feeling like I can't trust my memory freaks me the fuck out.

I guess this is more of a vent than anything. It's the first hypomanic episode I've had that can compete with (milder) depressive episodes in terms of negative impact on my life. I don't really know how to come to terms with the fact that I can't trust my memory from that time. Especially because according to friends I seemed pretty lucid, but my judgement was obviously impaired.

"This is not a cry for help or a pity party post, but I am looking for input on whoever reads the post and has any insight on ECT or TMS therapy...I am not doing well mentally. I have not been for a long, long time. With MDD (Unipolar) among other things such as GAD and PTSD, the low cycles come in waves, but the highs are always mild and do not always seem to last all that long.I have been told countless times that I am such a negative person, I complain a lot, or I never seem like I am having fun. I get blamed for a mental health disorder that I have been battling for years and have tried countless medications, therapists, psychiatrists, holistic supplements, meditation, testosterone therapy, to name the healthy and positive actions I have taken. I have also been dependent on alcohol and drugs, used sex and intimacy as a means of feeling better about myself, self-harm, attempted suicide for the negatives...Truth is, I really want to live and be happy and enjoy my life, but sometimes, especially lately, every day seems like an uphill battle, every day I have to fight myself just to get out of bed in the morning and go to work (and I have a good job and am doing well financially), every day, I worry that my mental illness is pushing people away in my life (fact: it has), every day I worry that I am ruining my relationship because of my inability to manage my emotions and mental health issues. I want so desperately to not feel like this anymore and I am running out of options that I have not already tried.I started looking into ECT (Electro-convulsive therapy) treatment as a last resort for treating my mental health issues and I was nervous about the risks associated (such as retrograde amnesia). I do not want to risk zapping away memories in my brain and losing part of who I am, but had decided to start looking into it as all else has failed so far. I was very fortunate to find that there is a safer alternative that is only available medically here in Austin. TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) is a safer alternative to ECT with less side effects and is less intrusive.I was worried about ECT because these treatments are a multi-week long process and ECT makes you lose short term memory temporarily and you need someone to pick you up and drop you off from the clinic, and it would have meant I would be unlikely able to work during the process. TMS does not have this same effect and I would be able to do it more independently and still be able to work.If I am being honest, I am still nervous about all of it. I have my first TMS consultation this afternoon. I want my brain to be healthy again, I want to be able to enjoy my life. I am so blessed to have the people in my life that I do, but I am just as frustrated at my lack of progress as anybody else who knows me and has had to deal with me. It certainly sucks so fucking much to always be told that I am not doing enough, that I create my own situation. If I have learned anything throughout all of this is that I do not have control over my emotions, I do not have control over my well-being, I do not have control over my life. But I want to. And I am getting to that point where maybe I do need it all zapped away and start afresh.

"I am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. I am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years, I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. When I was younger it was not a huge deal, but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a long-lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.The thing is, I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. Once the initial excitement wears off, I go back to being aloof, insecure and self-centered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding. I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship, I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.On top of it all, I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. I am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, I have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although I have tried, I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is, I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again, but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that, I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry (two semesters left), but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school, and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles?

"must bargain with the universe for social plans so my (18ftm) coworker ""evilyn"" (19f) was going to see a band at a music venue an hour away, she posted to her instagram story about needing a ride, i offered to take her because i want to get out of the house. she said she'd be down and now i'm just waiting for her to respond so we can plan stuff on SC. 

she mentioned having extra tickets, but i'm still buying my own because she didn't directly offer it to me, and i don't want to embarrass myself in case it's not implied. they're like 15$ each so it's not outlandish or anything. and i'm too afraid to ask to clarify like ""so if i'm going too would you give me one of your extra tickets?"" it's not unreasonable i know- if i were her i wouldn't mind the question but i'd feel like a terrible person for asking even if we were closer. also not going to clarify that this is 100% platonic because we're coworkers and i *think* she knows i'm gay (the one thing i miss about presenting female is that i never had to make those distinctions with other girls). but will live in fear of that misunderstanding nonetheless. 

another fear: evilyn is on pretty friendly terms with ""jonah"" (20M) our other coworker, a the one and only person ive ever romantically pursued (lots to unpack with that but for brevity's sake, let's not.) as in, they've hung out outside of work more than once. now, i don't think jonah is the petty type, but if evilyn mentions it to him i wouldn't put it past him to say something (idk what but not sure he likes me much at the moment) that would make her back out. and if that were the case she'd just make an excuse so i would never really know.

"I am on academical holiday from school, I am an active member of my highschool student council. From the past month the student council is training their 10 grader members (like me) to continue the 11grader periode because after the 11grader get to 12grader they cannot have any extracurricular or any organization activities. The 11grader is training us like crazy, everyday the will just gives us a task that sometimes does not contribute to how we will do the student council works in the future. Everyday they gives us those tasks even in Sunday we cannot have a break, and there happened the time when I and my friends did not sleep for 2 days straight, those task can take our time half the day and if we get evaluation(and punishment if we did some mistake even for the simplest mistake) after finishing the tasks it can finish until 10pm , I have been stressed out because of this from the past month and really make me exhausted. I often wake up with regret because of knowing there will be so many task to do, and not only that negative thoughts like ""i will get punished for not doing the task perfectly"" often make a fog in my brain and makes me cannot think clearly and worsen my stress. I became overthink because the 11grader seniors will really be mad and badmouthing us for not doing our tasks perfectly. I have been thinking of quitting the student council, but my worries are if I quit, those seniors will look down at me and our relation in school will be bad. I cannot take a good sleep for weeks now because anxiety keeps me checking what is update in my students council group chat. Again, so many negative thoughts in my mind because of that. Can someone give me a solutions or any suggestions?? Wake up and feel regret",Depression

"I luckily rarely feel bad depression, tonight is one of those times. This post is just to write it out of myself.I feel like I am in a battle with my own thoughts and emotions. Right now I feel alone even though I have people who support me. I do not want to give in to depression, but I also do not have life goals, motivation or really anything that excites me. I do not have a bad life, but I do not have anything going on now (no job, no healthy hobbies, no meeting with people). I was not fully okay when I still attended school either which makes me worried/scared that this feeling will come back even when I will finally have a job that occupies my mind.I am stressed about having to juggle and fix so many things in my life at once: work, friendships, house chores, anxiety, depression, hobbies, habits, therapist... it is too much, and it feels like I am going nowhere. It feels like that even though I try to be better, get better, it works only for some time then all comes crashing down. As if it was a sign that my efforts are worthless.I really want this war in my head to end. Even though anxiety and depression have been giving me a hell of a time in these past months, somehow I still have hope left. Somehow I still do not want to give up. I feel like I am super strong but at the same time I feel weak. Not always, just rarely. Normally I ""only"" feel meh, like my default is a bit lower than the average, so I can still function properly but I do not have a drive, an ambition for anything. I do not want to be on autopilot or worse anymore, I am not sure how to change that though.(there is no need to write anything under this post, like I said it is just to clear my headspace a bit.

I am going on a trip to see my family who is fairly toxic when it comes to weight and I am so fucking scared I already deal with body dysmorphia and I do not know what to do. I need to go from 170 to at least 150 or less in 3 weeks which means 6.67 pounds a week. How the fuck do I achieve something like that? Do I do less than 500 calories a day or something since you need 3500 calories burned to get rid of 1 pound of fat. And if my natural burn rate is 2000 calories a day and I eat 500, that is only 1500. So I need to burn 2000 more calories a day to achieve around a pound a day to keep my 6.67 pound a week loss.I am already dealing with really bad depression, which causes me to constantly overeat and binge because it makes me feel better, so now I need to control that to not get ridiculed by my fucking family.

"I came off as an asshole today and I’m struggling with it I went to the mall to buy some fragrances and I came off as a massive asshole to the cashiers. There was originally only one girl that was attending the area I went to, so I thought I would be fine. Wrong. She seemed like she was new and when I asked her for the fragrance I wanted she seemed confused and said she was going to get someone to help me. She came back with two women, and they’re all staring at me while I say what I want. Then one of the women she brought back started asking me questions, I wasn’t prepared for this and I sort of shut down. She asked me what I was currently wearing and I lied and said I didn’t wear anything currently, then she asked me if I would wear something sweeter than the fragrance I had picked out and I just shook my head and looked at some other bottles of perfume. I acted mostly dismissive towards the three women because I was so uncomfortable and just wanted the situation to end. I wanted to get out of the situation as fast as possible so I grabbed a different fragrance that I was familiar with and told them I would just buy that. 

I had tried to prepare myself beforehand to speak to one person, because the last time I went there was only one person I had to talk to. Talking to three people made me so uncomfortable and I acted like a dismissive asshole. I thought it would be really easy for me since I already knew what I wanted and I assumed I could just tell the lady the name of what I wanted and she would tell me whether they had it or not. I also feel really bad for the new girl because I could tell she didn’t really know what she was doing and I just made it worse for her. And the lady that was asking me questions seemed very nice and I feel bad for acting the way I did. Now that I think about it, the second lady was probably trying to set an example to the new girl and I ruined it for her. 

I had avoided buying fragrances online in fear that the bottles would break in the mail but I will probably only buy them online from now on.

This experience made me realize that I also act cold and asshole-ish to everyone that’s not the people I live with, or my mom. But that’s also the only way I can speak to people, so I’m kind of stuck between don’t socialize at all or act cold to everyone.",Personality disorder

"Can someone help me? Venlafaxin + Lithium Hi!  I have a major depression disorder, and I'm taking antidepressant meds for 4 years (3 years of Escitalopram (Lexapro)  and, since last year, a growing dose of Venlafaxin (Venlift)). Sadly, the antidepressants done nothing about my mood, so my psychiatrist considered the possibility of me suffering from bipolar II disorder.  She prescribed me 300mg of Lithium, sticking with the venlafaxin.

Has anyone had a similar experience? What should I expect? The Li will stabilize my mood and finally the venlafaxin (Now in 225mg) will do its job properly?

"I am twenty nine and I mostly want to disappear. I do not really want to die. What scares me the most is my ability to endure, and endure, and then endure some more. My life was designed to be shit from the moment I was born. My whole family is mentally ill; my mother is a bipolar who only got on meds well into her forties, my father is a high-ish functioning autistic, and my brother has had schizophreneia since he was fifteen. I have been abused by my parents for years, I have had two major depression episodes, one when I was twelve and one at eighteen, anxiety and panic attacks since I remember myself. I was never taken to a doctor as a child, I was seen by a psychiatrist later in life and was put on meds but could not tolerate them at all. I have never been in therapy. I have always been either overweight or skin and bones, I am socially awkward and too argumentative and bitchy and nerdy, all of which qualities are unforgivable in females who are not attractive. I have always been very introverted though it is not in my nature to be introverted, I have let people take advantage of me and I have abused myself in various ways. I never had an adult or older person who can guide me in any way, the only one for a while was my aunt, who would only help me financially, and since she told me that the reason she did it was so that I would be her nurse when she grew old, I have not spoken to her. I have only one friend, who lives in another city, who miraculously escaped the purge I did a few years ago. I literally cut ties with many people overnight in a fit of self respect. All my friends have been fake, because I do not have the ability to be vulnerable around people enough to form real connections. I have a boyfriend since three years ago who is from another country and I have not seen in a year and a half because of covid. I am a dropout, and right now I am completely broke and cannot work because of covid, and my boyfriend lost his job and is looking for one that will allow him to live overseas which seems impossible so far. We are both poor. Neither has a house, or money. I love him so much and he is the first person I was ever able to open up to the degree that I have. he is been with me through thick and thin, even though I am a horrible bitch and take out my anger on him sometimes. I am sometimes very toxic towards him. Intimacy often makes my skin crawl if I really think about it. He has his own baggage, but nowhere near as bad as mine. he is in therapy and keeps telling me I need to get a therapist. I think about breaking up with him all the time, because he deserves better. Sometimes I pretend to joke and tell him he should stay where he is and get a nice cute girlfriend with money, but I really do think about it. I think that if I do break up with him, it will have to be at a time when I will be able to off myself soon after, so that I will not feel pain for long. I have told him all these thoughts, and I think I freaked the shit out of him but he listened. he is the only good thing in my life, and that is why I feel like I need to protect him, by stepping aside.I feel like I am poison. I feel responsible for everything. Shame and guilt and the past stain everything. I have survivor's guilt over my brother, why did he get my mother's genes and not me? I have immeasurable anger towards my parents, my controlling psychotic mother and my father who has only checked in with his family to vent his anger. I feel contempt and envy towards sunny, happy people, even people with problems, even people with some problems, or one big problem. I am jealous of those too. I feel like no one can understand, I feel like no one has it as bad as I have it. Or maybe they do understand that is why they look at me with pity. I hate them, I hate people up close. The idea of people is much more appealing than the reality of stupidity, entitlement and selfishness. And yet am I any better? I want to disappear and fake my death and live away from society. I see people that leave everything behind and go live alone in some jungle or whatever, and I am so, so jealous of them. To constantly live in the moment, because you have no choice, because it is a matter of survival. I feel trapped and suffocating, and even though I do want to live, I want to be the person I feel I was meant to be, smart, funny, capable, I do not think it is meant to be. I feel like a naive idiot for having any dreams at all. I t does not help that I actually am naive and I have many life and money choices that really worsened things. I;ve been suicidal before and it was much more severe. I was this close and was stopped last minute. This time it does not feel urgent at all, it feels unavoidable. Steady but surely. The scary thing that I keep asking myself, is how much more can you take? The answer to that is: probably a lot more. And that I just cannot live with. I am emotionally burnt out. I am depressed. The thought of having to deal with anything is awful.I do not know why I am posting this. Probably to validate how shitty everything is. Everyone around me is acting as if nothing is wrong.

The risk is like a 0,2% increase in cancer but some believe the risk might be a little overestimated for CT scans. I will never accept another CT scan in my life, unless it's an emergency. All doctors said abdominal CT scans are better than MRIs so that's why I didn't get an MRI.

How do I get past this? I still have the pain and no diagnosis and I increased my risk of cancer. One way of dealing with the risk is to think of it like a screening, at least I know there isn't anything sinister going around in my belly.",Anxiety

"Losing friends over diagnosis? Just semi recently some people who I considered long time friends and I truly believe it’s because I was being more open about my diagnosis. For context they has DID and alters and I tried to accommodate for them as much as I could. Yet they randomly removed me after we spent a few weeks together (it was a visit) 
I don’t really know what went wrong as I took my meds and I have a passive nature in general. No manic outbursts or emotional ones at all.  We all were laughing and having a great time laughing and doing fun activities. But as soon as I got home one of them just didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. And I truly believe it was discriminatory behavior because I would bring up my diagnosis/ make jokes of because they would do the same. (Making jokes of my diagnosis helps me cope in a way) It took me bit to collect myself but I’m doing a whole lot better with therapy now that they’re not in my life anymore. They were also very against seeking medical advice for mental illness and rather get high and not address their issues with a professional. Has anyone else here ever lost close friends that backstabbed you over your diagnosis? Or is it better for people with this disease to just keep everyone at arms length and give the cold shoulder out of fear of discrimination or assumptions on what they think bipolar is? Most people don’t judge by the content of your character anymore and it’s so incredibly sad it has to be that way",Bipolar

"Hello I am just writing this on a whim so excuse my grammar and stuff Started the year real rough with school stress, family problems, financial problems, mental health problems, abusive family shit, the list goes on. I started going to therapy last month or so and I was progressing well. I was diagnosed with dysthymia and I was going into a more stable and functional state. I started to do my schoolwork again and I was managing my stress and intrusive thoughts better. I was proud that I was recovering and I was so excited to getting my life back together. But I guess I spoke too soon and I ended up relapsing this week. I do not know what triggered it, but I feel like it happened because I had a lot of slip ups this week (like messing up while doing chores, upsetting a friend, etc.) I ended up planning out three suicide plans and writing a tear and snot soaked suicide note (pretty gross I know). I am pretty angry at myself right now, because I feel like I wasted the efforts of my therapist, my friends (who helped me a lot with dealing with my bad stuff) and I feel like I wasted my own effort. what is worse is that being angry at myself just fuels my desire to kill myself even more. I do not have the guts to tell my friends about what I am feeling or thinking cos they are going through their own problems right now and I feel ashamed to even tell them because I am an awful friend cos I suck at being there for them emotionally (I am still learning how to be empathetic and how to comfort others, nobody really taught me as a kid so I am still developing on that aspect). My family does not acknowledge I exist anymore, and I am falling behind my school work. I just want to end things, because I just do not have a desire to live anymore.

"I was triggered while talking to an old school friend and crashed the interaction This happened 9 month ago.

I (M,50) was being approached by a woman that was in the same class in school with me some 30+ years ago. 

I was just loading groceries into my car when she drove past behind me and said loudly: ""oh hey, that's a familiar face... :-)"". 

I turned around and was pleasantly surprised to see her... we started to talk, she said she has seen me in this supermarket before. 

We exchanged some small talk... what do you do, where do you live, do you still have contact with the people of the past... this kind of stuff. 

I already was kind of nervous, because of the small talk situation, but when the topic of the other people from the past came up, i began to panic. 

The thing is, that i was being bullied for the 5 years that I was in this class. Not from her, she was always nice.

But the time in this class left it's marks and I didn't want to have anything to do with the people from these circles after I was done there.

So at the end of our talk she asked if we should exchange numbers... and i froze. 

There were just so many thoughts in my head, but i couldn't say any of them because none of these were appropriate for a casual conversation after 30 years.

A small part of me was flattered that she remembered me and cared to approach me.

But all the other parts of my brain were actively persuading me why this was not a good idea:

""when i exchange numbers i will have to be prepared for her to call/text anytime, i don't like this.""

""i clearly still have a problem with the ""old times"" and the people from the past.""

""when i call/text with her then i will have to explain this sooner or later or just lie and pretend that these things did not affect me.""

""this is not the kind of topic that i can casually bring up after 30 years, so i can't explain this, and don't think that i can lie, either...""

""besides, if i exchange numbers then i will have to, well, talk... text... ask questions... like a normal person, and since i live very isolated, i kind of forgot how to do this.""

""and what do i do if she wants to get a coffee... or meet others..."" 

""it's better to just end this here now and not exchange numbers.""

""but i can't say that i don't want to exchange numbers, who does something like this? i would have to explain this.""

I was spiraling...

I'm not sure how long i stood there saying nothing. I guess she could tell from my face that there was a problem.

Then she said: ""you don't have to say anything"".

I think I mumbled something like ""okay"", and ""it was really nice meeting you"" and we parted.

I should have just exchanged the number and go from there.

I really would have liked to be able to do this, but i couldn't.

I regret this now, and i am constantly thinking if i should contact her (I know her address but of course not her phone number, so i would have to write a letter i guess) and try to explain things.

At least tell her that it \*really\* was nice seeing her and that my reaction (or lack thereof), was not because of her, but had other personal reasons.

But of course, everything is much more awkward now than if i would just have exchanged the number...",Personality disorder

"Rabies Anxiety I’ve had a series of hypochondriac scares over the past few years, but most recently I’ve been concerned about rabies. About ten days ago I let my indoor cat out in the backyard to sun herself and I caught her hissing at (what I think is) a neighbor’s cat that had jumped over the fence. I didn’t want them to get in a fight so I shoo’d the other cat away and waited outside for my cat to calm down. After about ten minutes I picked up my cat to bring her inside and she freaked out and bit me. Since then, the though that she might have given me rabies has been constantly on my mind, causing a great deal of anxiety. I know that my cat is vaccinated (she was given a 3 year booster 2 and 1/2 years ago) and the neighbor cat was not rabid. I know that rabies, especially from cat to humans, is very rare in the US. I know that I’m being absolutely ridiculous, but knowing that doesn’t help. I keep thinking maybe the booster wore off prematurely, or the neighbor cat did have rabies and my cat bit her before biting me. It doesn’t help that I woke up today with a headache and a sore throat, two early symptoms of rabies, and that I’ve been having nightmares where I loose my mind and become aggressive.

"I know this sounds extremely melodramatic and like I am just over reacting... but I have been feeling like this for a while. I want to not exist.

(Frankly the only thing bringing me happiness in my life). Its how I destress and release my anger towards myself. But I recently had an knee injury and its just been confirmed my mri, I have a complete ACL torn. The whole process of surgery and rehab will be 9-12 months. I cannot do what I love during those times and by the time I can get back Ill probably be much much worse and have to pick it up from scratch. I have been away from sports for 2 weeks now and already my mental sanity has taken a huge fall from its already super fragile state. I am also known as the sporty person and I do not know how Ill survive being in crutches in school. I just do not know if its worth it. To go through the process, without any coping mechanism. I want to kill myself now if save me the trouble, the mental stress. I just want to die. because I do not think life is worth it.

"Venting Sorry if this isn't appropriate for here, but the stress is killing me. I'm 24 and I feel like I've got the stress of a 45 year old going through a midlife crisis! 

Three weeks ago, I started up a new job with security, I got one 6 hour shift, and three 12 hour shifts. Honestly, I love this job despite the hours, and I can handle it. 

But, this past week? Everything feels like it fell apart. My sister popped over with her husband on a surprise visit ( haven't seen her in 14 years ) so it should've been exciting, but all it did was bring trouble to our already fragile household. She instigated drama with my father and everyone else, then her boyfriend was just causing problems with zero consequences. Then, two days later, my Uncle shows up and it's all great.. up until he hits me with news tonight that he's got cancer and he's trying to enjoy himself since he's scared of worse case scenario. All of this on top of family dilemmas with my father, seeing it affect my grandmother? ALL tied together with the very awkward sleep I get, I can just feel my mental health regressing back to incredibly old, toxic, unhealthy ways. I wanna smoke weed to ignore the stress and call off work, but I know doing all that will ruin any progress I've ever made. 

Oh, I'm also having allergies worse than ever so my nose is constantly dried up, in pain, slightly bleeding and my eyes itch like hell. I know I'm just yapping at this point, but good lord, it feels like way too much to stomach in such a short amount of time.

"The last time I made a real friend was in the 1st grade. I do not mean irl, either. I mean a friend as in someone I can be myself around and feel that they want to keep engaging with me. The last of my real friendships fizzled out before I was 15. I grew up sheltered from the hardships of life, but at the same time, I was stunted from growth because the only person I could learn from was an abusive alcoholic older brother. He kept me alive, but prevented me from learning how to be normal. So I retreated as far as I could, to the point where it got physical. In the last years of middle school, I stopped applying myself in school, doing nothing with my time except reading or being absent-minded. After my first year of highschool, at the age of 17, I ran away. I took a bus to my hometown and tried to reconnect with old friends. I had fun for a few months, and I learned a lot of essential things both about myself and about the real world. Then, as suddenly as it began, it ended. I had burned any bridge that could keep me where I wanted to be.I called my brother, begged forgiveness, and came back to him. He had not changed at all. It clashed violently with my newfound outlook on life, and his abuse reached an all-time high for the remainder of my 17th and 18th years on Earth. My depression came back, but I did not retreat. I fought back, mentally and physically. Eventually the abuse stopped completely. I do not know why really. But I was left in a position where my brother was my life-source, and at the same time, I did everything in my power to not engage with him.I am 23 now. I have been in the same position since then. In the handful of years past, I have tried to spark relationships with other people. Both irl and online, platonic and romantic. However, I cannot make anything work. I am fundamentally broken with no fix in sight. The only person who has expressed a want to help me is my little sister, and I cannot even bring myself to tell her what is wrong with me. I cannot fucking talk to people. I cannot look people in the eyes. I cannot feel empathy. I write this with the full expectation that it will gather no attention. I have a burn in my mind. It throbs with pain, easily dulled with distractions, but never healing. I want to feel normal. I feel like I have got a permanent burn.",Depression

"Proud of Myself Hi everyone! It's been a while since I posted on this sub and I really wanted to share a small success story to hopefully help you if you need it.

So this past summer I was active on here all the time. I was convinced I had a brain tumour, bone cancer, blood clots, and a bunch of other issues. 

I ended up starting therapy in September and it's been going great! I've been able to stop immediately seeking reassurance (i.e. going to the ER) and dealing with my fear of death. I still struggle with googling and the initial worry of symptoms, but I can honestly say I'm starting to get better.

Anyways, I feel like I had a major milestone today - even if it doesn't really seem like that big of a deal. 

My health anxiety is mostly focused on myself, but also extends to other people I care about, like my family. So naturally, when my mom told me she found a large lump on her breast while showering, I panicked. Like full blown panic. I immediately thought the worst (shocker), especially because just two months ago she'd gotten called back for an abnormal mammogram and had to do a bunch of imaging tests to make sure it was nothing terrible. That week waiting for results was excruciating (thankfully it was just benign cysts). Naturally, this brought me back to that terrible week of worry, and I was immediately thinking that, despite 2 mammograms + an ultrasound not even two full months ago, that the doctors must have missed something and that she had a terrible disease.

My initial instinct was to google - I tend to seek out information in times of stress because it helps me feel like I have some control over the situation. I was so tempted to google incidence rates of breast cancer, likelihood of breasts cyst vs. cancer, and the like. I had intentions of reassuring myself, but I also knew that doing that would only feed into my anxiety and make it worse. Despite how badly I wanted to do research, I forced myself to ignore the compulsion. I was also able to rationalize and talk through my fears to come up with a logical conclusion (i.e. family history of cystic breasts = likelihood of cyst vs. cancer)

Thankfully, our family doctor believes that it's just a cyst that was seen on the mammogram, but filled with fluid due to her upcoming period. He's sending her for an ultrasound to be safe, but overall isn't worried.

However, despite all this, I feel really proud of myself! I managed to avoid Googling because I knew it would harm me, even if I was convinced it would help me. I really feel like I accomplished something, and I hope that sharing this encourages any of you who need help to get it. Therapy has been a godsend for me, even if it's just in small steps like this.",Anxiety

An acceptance. A knowing: this is what life is, this is what people are like, this is your life. Meaningless receptor of pain. A type of damage and grief that is so large it has become a void inside me without echo. I just exist in it. Laying staring in the distance. I stopped fighting. I lay dying figuratively now. Just darkness, the silence, the depth, the fright, the terror. I feel like an helpless animal that was being attacked so at first I fought frantically. Now I just lay no longer fighting back, not crying though the pain is present, being terrorized abused, destroyed. I am disassociating as I lay dying. My breaths are heavy like my mind.

I need someone to talk to. My life is a disappointment. 

I want to give back to my parents, what I am now is because of them. It hurts me seeing them getting old as time goes by.

 I haven't achieved anything in life. My thoughts are drowning me. Always too tired even without doing anything. Tired of life, only sleep is my therapy. 

My partner has her own problems, she's too busy with everything. My closest friends have left me. I dont want my parents to worry. My brother has his own family. I don't have anyone to confide to. Life is draining me to my core. 

Never felt so alone in my life. People are around me everyday but no one seems to care. I've been pretending to be okay for the longest time. I'm no longer my previous self, the confident one, the know it all, the positive guy. I have no ambition, no expectations, all I care now is how to finish the day. This has been my lowest state, my whole body is aching, my soul is hurting, my brain decided to stopped working.

"Am I Going Crazy? So, I’m a healthy 27 year old American woman (today is my birthday) and the last few months have been almost unbearable and I can’t seem to get a grip on anything. For reference, it all started last November when I started having pain in my upper left abdomen that wouldn’t seem to go away. I’m currently living in Spain, which is where I’m currently living and working. My doctor said that I had acid reflux and told me to what I ate. Pain persisted, lots of mucus coming out, constipation, tons of gas. Decided to take a probiotic and managed to get my symptoms to disappear for a month while on winter break. Then in January, the pain came back. My stools were hard and dark, and the pain was consistent. Had an ultrasound and was told that I had tons of gas in my colon so they couldn’t see clearly, but my other organs looked good. But then, my coworker suddenly began having blood in her stool too and many intestine issues. Turns out that she had worms. I decided to check my stool, found something that looked like a worm, went to the emergency room, tool mebendazol to get rid of the worms (This also made sense because I lived in Asia for 2 years before Spain and had just recently moved).
Just after my first dose of mebendazole, I started to have a weird feeling in my lungs. Felt like I couldn’t breathe in all the way, but that was it. Anyway, in addition to that, I began to have sinus pressure, a mild sore throat, and drainage. 
I took my second dose of the worm medicine, had a stool sample that came back clear of everything (no blood), and even a chest X-ray that was clear. I’ve been secretly worried that I have colon cancer since a friend of mine suddenly died at age 25 from it. She had no symptoms and went to the doctor with a persistent cough and ended up having stage 4. Since my lung issues flared up, I’ve been so worried that I have some cancer that has metastasized and went to my lungs. I haven’t been able to completely shake this cold yet and it’s been over 3 or 4 weeks. I still wake up and spit up yellowish colored spit. Lungs feel a bit off. To make matters worse, I’m still having stomach problems after being cleared of the worms and my doctor says that I probably have IBS. Then, last night, I began having heart palpitations and rushed to the emergency room. My EKG was normal and my blood test was normal. She said I have pvcs and need to relax. Honestly, I just feel like I’m shutting down and I haven’t felt healthy in a long time. I can’t seem to shake this chest cold, my digestive problems are still there, have some reflux too, and now pvcs.

"What If You’re Doing Better Than You Think? It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

**Genuine Desire + Effective Strategy + Consistent Persistence = Authentic Results**",Stress

"I have been struggling with this for as long as I can remember, where I feel suicidal after making small mistakes or after someone makes an offhanded comment towards me that I take to heart, even if they did not mean it that way, or even the thought of people (even total strangers) being mad at me makes me feel terrible about myself that I am a bad person and I deserve to die.

"how did buspirone/buspar make you feel? did you take it consistently or only as needed? hi anxious friends! i recently switched my meds from effexor to prozac and added buspirone 10mg for anxiety. my doctor told me to take it as needed, but after all the research ive done, this doesn't make sense to me. how would it even be effective if i only took it as needed, if it's not a fast/immediate acting drug? it builds up in your system over time, right? so i'd need to take it consistently for a long period of time to feel any effects? ill ask my doctor too of course, but im very interested in other people's experiences with buspirone specifically, and whether you took it as needed or daily. 

ive been taking 10mg 3x a day for about a month (with some missed doses in between) and i do feel less anxious, but the way my doctor described it made it sound like it was a fast acting anti anxiety drug that calms you down after you take a dose, rather than one that builds in your system over time. if it matters, i also take concerta and bupropion. 

thanks friends :)",Anxiety
"Fighting the stigma against medicating mental illness so people like me don't wait forever to get help Hey there! I'm bipolar and have had a lot of success with lamotrigine, but it took me a really long time to start taking it because there's such an intense stigma around medicating mental illnesses. I kind of assumed I would lose all sense of self if I took them, and I wish I didn't have that feeling for so long (over a decade).

So I started up a project called Wear Your Meds recently to try and help other people not feel that way. Basically it's a series of 1"" buttons, and each button shows a commonly-prescribed mental illness medication. Anyone who wears one of these buttons is signaling that they’re open to sharing their personal story of how the medication helped. It's also a show of solidarity because sometimes it can feel like no one else you know is on meds. I'm hoping some people on here would be into it. More info is at wearyourmeds.com",Bipolar
"Idk, I just feel like I need to say this, my mental state is going really really fucking fast downhill really fucking quickly. I have been struggling with this shit as long as I can remember, and I honestly can barely take it anymore. I have no clue why I have let myself live so long.my mental health is beyond shit, cronic depression or whatever the fuck it is. My social life, the only thing in life I have been clinging on to the past year, is also beyond shit. All of the friends I thought were my friends all ghosted me at once over the summer, even ones who promised me they would not ghost me like they always do. My home life is fucking chaotic and it only makes things several several times worse, believe it or not I am having some struggles when it comes to just being able to cope with the fucking abuse that gets thrown at me, like my therapist wants me to do. My physical health is the same, idk if I was just born different or whatever but my body's just fucked up. I am always in constant pain no matter what I do and it is just becoming too much to handle, you know, to the point of thinking death would be better than this.I can go on and on complaining about this shit, but apparently it is bad enough that I have been told to kms. Because it would put me out of my misery- not to be mean or anything. Yeah-Last time I was in the mental hospital for wanting to commit die, after kind of ranting about my home life my roommate was telling me that if I wanted to kill myself, they would support me fully.I have literally heard someone have a full on MENTAL BREAKDOWN because they thought that trying to convince me to not kill myself was selfish. Because they felt horrible for just making me suffer longer, and did not know if dying would just be the best option for me.I have shared these thoughts with people close to me and it usually ends with them giving up on me. I cannot count the amount of times I have heard stuff like this.Tell me death would not be the solution to all my problems. Tell me ending my life would not be by far the most effective way of no longer suffering, and fixing my problems. Tell me. I cannot count the amount of times I have been told to kill myself.

"Sorry in advance if some sentences do not make any sense as I am not a native speaker. Most of my english comes from memes and series. I am 25 years old male, big loser with no education and living in a shit hole. I have been depressed since I have been concious, and the pain has been gradually increasing to a point that I feel like I cannot take it anymore. My father was not present when I was a kid, and because my mom had to take care of me alone, she overworked herself so she could sustain her kid. The absence of my father and mother in my life hurted me a lot, and while I despise my father for leaving my mom when she was pregnant, I can totally understand why she was absent and trying to give me a decent life to her best efforts. I was physically abused by my babysitter on a daily basis. It was very hard for me to articulate to my mom what she was doing, and this ended when a friend of my family witnessed what she was doing to me one day. After that, I started living alone in our house because my mom could not trust anyone else to take care of me (this was when I was 9 yo). At my 11 years of age, I was sexually abuse by a woman that was 4 years older than me. The experience was very traumatic and sex has always been very difficult since then. All of my romantic relationships have ended in abandonment from my partner, and I wonder if the sexual abuse that I suffered earlier has to do with that. I deserted my undergrad (Mechatronics) because I was scared of failing again in life, and running always seemed easier and safer (I deeply regret this now that I am older, but it is too late to go back). Now I am stuck in a third world country with a very high crime rate and extreme poverty, with no education, no good jobs prospects, nothing. I was very close to end my life a few days ago, but my current girlfriend decided to call me randomly and I broke down into tears and told her everything, and she convinced me to not do it. I have never tried suicide before, but that day I was completely commited to end my life violently and for good. My current relationship is long distance. she is in another country, with an ok job and is on her way to become a permanent resident. Because of my lack of education and preparation, it is almost impossible for me to go to where she is. We met when we were younger in the current country that I live in, and we had a relationship but she left me for reasons that I did not know back then, and then we reconnected few months ago and we are together again (yea, I know that this was a very bad decision). I have decided that I am going to ilegally inmigrate to a first world country and gamble my life there. My options are limited and I fucking hate life so why not? This was a decision I made before I got into this relationship, but now that I am compromised with someone, and realised that there is no way in hell we could be together because she would have to leave everything just to live together with a good for nothing. It really sounds ridiculous. She says that she is deeply in love with me, and would do anything to be together. I feel like what is going to happen is that she is going to realise that she had to sacrifice a lot for an unknown future with someone that is a loser and will end up hating me. I also deeply love her, and I do not think I could forgive myself ever. I want to end my life. I do not think I can fix my situation, and even so, the temptation of killing myself will ever go away. I am so sorry for my mother that had a very rough life, and it seems that I am about to just make it more miserable for her. I hope that my mother, girlfriend and friends could forgive me, but maybe that is asking for too much. I definitely do not deserve any of that. Thank you for reading my story. Am at my wits' end.

"Where do I begin to get help? I'm a 27 year old female. I've probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it. 

I feel like im just always in a constant state of worry. So much so that it drives me to have small OCD traits. Something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before I leave the house. Over and over......and over again. It's weird. 
 
I'm always worrying about the future, past things I can't change, things I say or do after im with people, how people view me, if I have a ""too much"" gene. I'll sit and agonize over things that's so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall. To the point of frustration where I just lose it and cry into a panic. 

I dont even know where to start to solve this. I feel like the past year it's been horrendous and getting increasingly worse. I'm good at playing it off. I'm good at putting on a show because I've always thought I could handle it- lots of people I know feel the same. But it's really starting to take a toll on my life and the things I'm doing or too afraid to even try to do.

I feel like I use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. Not an outrageous amount but I'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause I've worried myself into thinking I have a problem and need self control. 

I'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but I feel like my mind is just in a dark place. Telling myself I'll never make it, that I'll always be alone, etc.

It's really stupid things to stress over. Or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. 

Money is always a bug stress factor- for everyone of course but thats the main reason I think I've never gone to get help. I'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help I need or where to even go. Not to mention the fear I get trying to explain how I feel to someone and them thinking I'm crazy or I'm making it up- how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me....

I just feel like if I dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then I wont have a fulfilling one. I'll be too afraid to try new things that scare me, I'll stick to my same safe routine, and I'll come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily.

Why is AVPD considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? So from what i have read seems like AVPD is the only pure ego-dystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are ego-syntonic in nature but in the case of AVPD seems like no one likes to have this condition. So why isn't AVPD considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with AVPD seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem?

I love most of my friends, but I can never talk to them about my personal life, because I have built a facade of being an emotionless goofball.

"I am going into senior year in high school this year, and for as long as I can remember I have just felt like I do not fit it. Like I do not belong. After a few years, I would say around 6th or 7th grade it turned into depression. I was seemingly indifferent to nearly everything imaginable. I was not sad, I was not happy, I was neutral. And it is been the same since then. I have no reason to not be happy. I live in an upper middle class family. Nice house, my parents are great, my older brother is as nice as an older brother can be. I have a nice job and get paid well. I am just not happy for some reason. I had friends for a while, but one day I stopped texting first and after a bit I never heard from them again. But the was okay, I am pretty antisocial anyway. it is been years since I had any real friends. I have never had an real interests, nor hobbies. I have done many sports, but only because my parents made me. I was just mediocre at them. I always just wanted to go home and go back to sleep. My latest sport I did was Mountain Biking, I did it 9th and 10th grade but quit before the season for 11th grade started. Since then, I have not done much. I just wake up, go to school/work, come home, lay in bed for a few hrs and eventually go to sleep for the night. Rinse and repeat. I do not know what I want to do as a career. I do not know what I want to go to college for, if I do go to college. I think id be fine majoring in whatever. I am not interested in pursuing anything, because I have nothing I want to pursue. I had never experienced suicidal thoughts until now, I think I was pretty content with my life up until a few weeks ago. Since then I have just found myself asking over and over, ""is this life really worth it?"" ""why should not I just do it?"" I have had a really bad time sleeping lately because of these thoughts. Hence why I am posting this at 1am haha. I have never self harmed before, never seen the point. Never had the incentive to. If I were to commit, I would want it to be quick and as painless as possible. I have thought it over a ton. I have been tempted to unbuckle my seatbelt while driving and just slam into a tree, obviously have not worked up the gut to do that yet. I have been tempted to use a noose, but I have not found a place to hang it. Lastly, I have thought of just slitting my throat. I think if I were to commit that would be the most likely because. Anyway, back to it. I do not have a reason I should feel this way, everything in my life is fine. And that makes me feel worse. It makes me feel guilty. And that guilty feeling does not help. it is just and endless cycle round and round. I thought maybe writing this down might help, and there was no reason not to so why not.

"I am horrible with words and conveying thoughts so a ""she will"" is the best way I can describe this feeling. I remember May of 2018 when I graduated from college. That was a wonderful experience and a serious milestone in my life. I was so proud of my accomplishment and was absolutely elated the entire week through the graduation ceremony. I felt excited to begin the new chapter of my life: starting a new job, making my own money, having my own true apartment. At that time I felt pretty happy.In January of this year I had been offered a new job (after searching for 18 months). I had received a 40% salary increase, had the opportunity to move to Atlanta and move back in with my twin brother. One would argue that this was a serious milestone I achieved after graduating from college. should not I be elated about this opportunity? I have been in the new job for 5 months, the new city for 3 months. As I am typing this post out, I am doing some serious soul searching and asking myself, ""How do I truly feel about this incredible milestone?"" that is just it, I do not feel anything. All I truly feel towards this is ""it is a milestone, and it happened."" Its like there is this she will around me that refuses any emotion from entering. I would hate to use the word ""dull"" but that is really what it feels like. The outward emotion that this entire milestone feels, just ""dull"". And yet in reality ""dull"" is not at all how I should be describing this insane achievement. Honestly, its hard to explain.Side note: I have not been diagnosed with depression but today at work my boss noticed I was making more mistakes than usual so he asked me ""Is everything going OK in your world? Atlanta still treating you OK? Just wanted to check in on you because its not like you to make mistakes. Let me know if you need anything."" Him questioning this made me think about the status of my mental state over the past few days and ""a she will"" is how I would describe it.

Struggling with an ED (anorexia in the past) and currently binging everyday because of the alcohol, also having a new job deeply triggering everything mentioned before because I am left alone for days. I cannot handle any responsibilities and I am really failing life. I am tired of having to fight my own mind, and that crippling emptyness.

"Rabies HA is driving me batty Hi fellow anxiety sufferers

&amp;#x200B;

I've been good for months but my HA has decided to welcome the new year with a flare up. A few nights ago I was reading in my bedroom with the window open, when I heard some rustling/flapping at the curtain. I went to take a look and couldn't see anything except for two large geckos. I guess they could have been chasing each other on the curtain, causing the rustling, but who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I went back to the bed and was facing away from the window with my hand resting behind my head, when I felt a sharp sensation in one of my fingers. I looked around and couldn't see anything, and there were no puncture wounds or marks on my hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story kinda short, I've convinced myself that a rabid bat flew into my room, snuck up on me, nipped my finger and then ninja'ed itself away – this despite there being no actual sighting of a bat or any wound.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise how irrational and ridiculous this all sounds, but nonetheless, the fear of dying from rabies is real and it's driving me a little nutty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to mention that I don't live in a rabies hot spot, the incidence of rabies in humans from bat bites in my country is very low, and apparently fewer than 0.5% of the bat population is rabid. So...

&amp;#x200B;

I really just want to go get some rabies shots but I reckon my doctor will think I'm nuts. Any advice on how to deal with this anxiety or any words to help put my mind at ease would be much appreciated!",Anxiety

"I moved to Utah about a year and a half ago. We went outside of the polluted city for the first time during the pandemic. We stayed for so long that it was pitch-black on the drive home. I looked out the car window and was able to see the entire milkyway, millions of stars and the bluish purple hues. I was so overwhelmed because it was my first time seeing so many stars. I felt like I was going to fall in to the sky. All I could think about since that was that I wanted to go out in the wild again and lay down and watch the stars all night. During some very tough days this past year, my boyfriend asked me what I wanted to do, he was ready to take me anywhere and make it happen just to see me happy again. I asked him to take me to see the stars again. Its so fucking cliche, I am so sorry but that is just what I really wanted. So he promised me. We never actually went. Whenever it comes up, its always either too expensive, too dangerous, I am not trying hard enough to plan it, hes not super interested in seeing it anyway etc. We have been wanting to go somewhere but everything is too expensive and not worth it. Yet he goes out drinking every weekend and ends up spending hundreds of dollars and gets trashed.Yesterday he was on the phone with one of his friends and his friend mentioned going to a popular camping spot (also popular star gazing spot) and within minutes they planned a trip to go the next day. I was in the room and could hear the entire conversation. They went out drinking to discuss the plans and I was not invited or even looked at in the face. I left his apartment and went home. I feel so betrayed and lonely. Am I overreacting? Maybe, but considering it was literally the only thing my depressed ass wanted to do, I think its okay to feel extremely upset and want to break up with him because I literally have no worth to him. I am not good enough to camping with for 1 night, not even good enough to be invited to the one thing I wanted to do. And if its another event I am always invited last minute and never have time to get ready and he complains that hes sick of explaining why I do not show up at events. I feel like hes just setting me up for failure and complaining to me about it. I had only one thing I was actually looking forward to this entire year and my boyfriend betrayed me",Depression

"Experiences with Lamictal and hypomania? Experiences getting off Lamictal? Hi! This is my first time posting here. If I may, do any of you have experiences with what I put in my title?


Here's some (not super necessary for answering my questions) background:

I have a diagnosis of Bipolar type 2. While for many reasons I still believe this to be accurate, I've been questioning the role that Lamictal has played in my illness and diagnosis.

While I had had many sort of hypo-hypomanic periods before, and had actually been diagnosed before at age 13, my first full blown, classically symptomatic hypomanic episode coincided with starting and then increasing my dose of Lamictal. This particular episode was used as a part of my diagnosis. (I started Lamictal due to a severe upswing in my depression and history of not responding to antidepressants.) The hypomania eventually faded back into my more typical depressions and general emotional static. This was then further complicated by the addition of other meds that I did not do well with at all. It's a bit of a tangle, so attempting to determine if there's any sort of clear chain of cause and effect is difficult.

I've never had any other side effects, but I've also never really felt any steadier on Lamictal. Lithium is what eventually became a total godsend for me.

All of this is to say that I don't know if Lamictal has actually done anything positive for me. Yet I've been kept on it ever since and I'm questioning if this is only because I haven't had any side effects to complain about. If this is true, is there really any point to continuing to take it long term? If I don't have to spend the money every month and continue to risk the known short term and unknown long term side effects, I'd rather not.



So, has anyone else experienced hypomania that coincided with starting or increasing Lamictal? Has anyone gone through getting off of it? What is the process of doing that like?

I am, of course, not going to change anything without talking to my pdoc. I'd just like to hear from some other people with personal insight.

Thank you!",Bipolar
"Does this just sound like anxiety/depression? Hey! I know you guys arent doctors, and I am waiting for a call back from psychiatrists, but I was wondering if any of you guys have had similar symptoms and could give me some insight.

I feel like the way most people describe there anxiety is a lot different than how mine feels.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I just get these episode where everything gets ""scary."" I just feel confused and very on edge and everything makes me jumpy. My life feels almost like a horror movie during these times. Usually a small sound (such as my fridge, PC, anything really) will seem to grow louder and seem eerie/spooky. My thoughts go down this loop of ""Do I have some sort of serious chronic mental illness, will I feel this way forever, will it get worse?"" And of course I try to shut these thoughts down and sometimes can, but the feelings are still there and very real. Sometimes I get very weird (and super brief) thoughts of doing rash things (flipping the fuck out on my grandma for example). It feels like there's an anchor in my stomach and sometimes, but not usually, Ill get shaky and have heart palpitations. These episodes last for well over 15 minutes and I never feel normal afterwards so I get annoyed when people label them as simple panic attacks, because they way other people describe there's, I feel as though mine are a lot different. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to add, is over the summer I did acid for the first time, and I always read that acid will onset any mental illness you are going to get in the future. So I often fear that I did acid and fucked myself over because of it, but nobody on either side of the family has a history of schizophrenia or anything of the sort.

"Found out I can press criminal charges against my childhood abuser: my mentally ill brother who attempted a school shooting I have a violet schizophrenic/autistic brother who SA me and almost killed me multiple times during rage or psychotic episodes. 

During these episodes, he would get violet in public. In middle school he had attacked the school cop, grabbed his gun, and tried to shoot at students leaving a school assembly. Lucky, the cop arrested him. After that, rumors started about me. I had left school for a year to deal with a serve kidney issue. Rumors came that I was in a mental hospital and no one would speak to me. 

Here is the thing: Both my parents are accomplished attorneys. They were able to have the charges dropped and he was home a year later. He would still hit me, strangle me, stab me. I had to sleep with a knife under my pillow because he would break in and watch me sleep while he spoke to voices in his head. 

A few years later he almost murderes my mom. He hit my mom with an iron bar over her head, one more hit and she would have been dead. Again, they played their cards and he was home within a year. I would state to my parents about the abuse, how I was scared for my life. 

They said I was overacting. Nothing was done to help me. I became so stressed and scared my awful father tried to put me in a group home because I said I didn't want to live there. Yet, the person who caused my distressed and harm was living at home and not in the mental institution.

I spoke to my therapist about this. She said since I'm only in my early 20s I can still press criminal charges against him. I am broken. I want to press charges but my parents will shun me. My parents help me financial since I am unable to work because of my kidney and seizure disorder. I know they would leave me homeless or try to get back at me and charge me with a stupid crime. My father was able to lie to the police operator about my mom to have her arrested and institutionalized. 

I am terrified of my father, and my mom cares more about my brother than I. She knows he raped me and hurt me, but still demands I come to his birthday or she won't pay my rent. Also, he SA my mom multiple times while I was a teen. Yet, my mom says she stays with him for his money. She would tell me thus as a teen, which is so sick to involve a child when you are staying with him.

I want to charge him so badly. My parents lied to me when I was a teenager when I wanted to go to the police. They said that the police won't help me. Finding our that my family lied to me, knew about the abuse, and now several years later learning he could have been charged is destroying me. 

I want to press charges. I have no money for an attorney.

I'd lose everything, become homeless, my mom who is the only person I care about would never speak to me again. I am having horrible flashbacks.

"Really worried about my kidneys. Any advice? I'm a 20 year old male, 5'7"", 130lbs. I got blood work done and it found my Ferritin to be high at 328 ug/L and B12 high at 658 pmol/L and high LDL cholesterol at 3.39 mmol/L. My eGFR is 88 with Creatinine at 105 umol/L and magnesium at 0.99 mmol/L. My urine came back negative for protein, blood and nitrite. A week later I had Ferritin tested again and it was 427ug/L.  I also had an abdominal ultrasound which showed regular kidneys but a 3mm ployp was found on my gallbladder. It sound be noted that all the test I've done thus far has not been for my kidneys but a pain in my abdomen which I'm seeing a GI specialist for. Should I though look into my kidneys? As these findings from what I've read may seem normal for an older person but not a 20 year old. Also would working out hard just over 24hr before the test affect the results? Or a meat heavy diet dispite a 12hr fast? Thanks

"I have been having a very difficult 8 months, in all the ways possible and had been contemplating taking my life for basically the entire time. it is not something I have really talked to many people about, and had been working to see a therapist as soon as possible, but have been having issues thanks to insurance. I kept telling myself ""if I feel this way in 3 months, then I will look into my options to end the pain."" And 3 months came and went, and I still felt that way. 6 months passed and I would find myself laying in my bed with tears in my eyes, watching the latest news of how humanity is destroying itself and wishing I was not alive. 8 months went by in a depressive fog and I continued trying to give myself hope for a future, with very little luck. It has felt like despite trying to do everything right, nothing has gone right or even slightly in my favor. This morning I felt the urge to end my life stronger than I have felt in my adult life. In a puddle of tears, contemplating how to take my life I asked myself ""what am I even living for anymore?"" And my phone rang. My phone ID showed the caller was my beloved sister who I have not talked to in months. I could not bring myself to tell her my mental struggles, but hearing her voice saved me. And without knowing what I was going through, she delivered the words I needed to hear most. She gave me hope again when I felt it was all but lost. From one sad heart to another, *PLEASE* do not give up hope. The people who love you would miss you more than could be put into words. (I know this bc I have survived many suicides in my life and each one hurt in ways I still have not been able to fully process.) It may feel rough today, tomorrow, and possibly for years to come. But it does get better. Just remind yourself that you *can* do hard things, even if the hard thing is an internal battle with yourself. But if you give up that fight you do not end the pain, you just gift the pain to anyone who has ever loved you.My only advice is do not struggle alone, it makes everything so much harder. Call someone, anyone you know that cares, call a crisis hotline, write an anonymous post, go do something you love, try something new, but especially treat yourself with kindness. You are not required to be happy every second of every day of your life. You are human, and the human experience is a messy one. So, be messy, love. do not lose hope.",Suicidal

"I am going to rant. What I want in life is to be loved as deeply as I think I love. And I do not know if I will ever get it, only because I am selfish and I am always going to want more. Or one day I am get it and it will be unhealthy for me. But I want to arrive at the end of my life someday and think about how much I have loved and how much I have been loved. I want people to be sad and I want people to remember me, not for what happened when I was there, but the emotional hole that I have left on their life. Like even now I fantasize about dating a girl, or making friends with a guy, and being so close to that person that when I leave, or am pushed away, they will always remember me because of whatever effect I had on them. And I want them to be sad about it. I think that is as best as I am going to be able to describe it. I feel like I am constantly holding on for dear life on a cliff and my grip is about to run out. there is just a constant strain to do anything. there is just a pull in the back of my head constantly weighing me down, so I am constantly feeling that and thinking about that, but then everything else just happens. Things have just been happening and I have just been there to experience it. Like I cleaned up most of my yard untill I got tired, then I did the kitchen, then I did the back yard. I do not think I made that much of a decision to do those things but they happened. Cutting myself too. I only recently figured out that I am doing that so that I have the scar and I can see it. And it sounds dumb saying because why else would you do it. But I just have been. I have always focused on the quality of my cuts so that way they leave a scar but. Everyday feels like a one note day, and no matter what happens, or what connection I make with people, it resets the next day and I forget. that is another foggy thing I think. Spend a very busy day at the carnival with friendsx go home and sleep, wake up and only have four real things that I can remember from that night.

"People with depression are strong as fuck. Seriously, every single one of us are fucking warriors. 

From the monumental effort it takes to drag ourselves into consciousness when we just want to sleep forever to showing up at work &amp; pretending you haven’t spent the morning crying or thinking of hurting yourself or wanting to just check out permanently or all of the above.

I know it’s horrible that we do have to deal with it, but taking a second to recognize how monumentally tough we are is important I think as we always get stuck on the things we hate about ourselves.

hello i am i had been very reluctant to admit i wa depressed but it s very hard to hide at this point plus who am i kidding apparently it written over my face for people who have known me for a while it really hurt me when people ask how are you i can not tell if they are just being cordial or they truly care i assume the former for them and respond i am good okay but every time i say i am good i feel slightly sadder because i know that is not the case i want to speak about this to friend but i do not really feel close to any friend anymore i moved country so this could be a contributing factor so here i am on reddit i have attended university twice now and already going to have a delay on this degree which mean another year of my life wasted to chasing a degree 9 i have been very disconnected from friend over the last two year and have felt like i am in a prison because i have mostly spoken extensively to just two people over last two year maybe this is because i am extroverted i do not recognise myself anymore i used to be so positive and strong mentally but a lot of negative thinking and bad thought have engulfed me for a while now i used to be very funny and enjoyed joking around but thats vanished these day i used to be very athletic and worked very hard to get lean after antipsychotic made me gain weight but now i am starting to put some weight back on because i have been using unhealthy food to cope these day my mind is flooded with so much negative thought pattern it s becoming too exhausting and i can barely study despite my best effort and knowing final are next week mostly quit social medium especially instagram because all it make me do is compare myself to others and reminds me of how unaccomplished i feel and the older i get the more i start to fear that i might actually go nowhere and how it might be better to die young and full of potential than a wasted life will i get back to how i once wa before my mental health went to shit is there a way out for good i have tried therapy but didn t work my last therapist told me she doesn t know why i am depressed because i am very good looking smart likeable and said to cheer up like it wa that simple,Depression

"I'm so tired of trying to be okay. When I don't exercise regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to go into social settings and interact with others, especially friends, semi-regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to switch up my routine, it happens and it happens when I have no routine. It happens when I don't get enough sleep, when I don't spend enough time outside and the list goes on. It's exhausting. And while a lot of these habits/things are enjoyable in the moment, once I push past my ""but I don't wanna"" inner toddler brain, I'm so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain ""okay"".And truth be told, lately, I haven't. Life has been unnecessarily shitty and I've had to make so many decisions and compromises on big things like my job and living situation that I crumpled. And I know working out would make a much bigger difference to my mood right now than writing this post, but I'm sick of everything. Why does life insist on being such a shit show?

Update: After writing this, briefly texting with a redditor, who was kind enough to reach out to ask if I'm okay and feeling my feelings for a bit (aka crying), I put on my workout clothes and got it over with. It didn't do much right then and there, but I also went to bed on time, to get a proper night's rest and I woke up feeling a little better.

"Could really use someone to talk to. I’m falling apart Never in a million years did I think I’d be on Reddit writing something like this but maybe this is my soul trying to find some sort of salvation from the pain. I’ve been thrown into the proverbial fire as of late &amp; I feel like I’m just unable to get a grip on anything. 

1. My father passed away &amp; I hadn’t spoken to him in well over 10yrs prior to his passing. He was extremely abusive to me as a child to the point or making me bleed. I am not really sad about his passing but feel many of the “what if” things in relation to a better childhood.

2. I found out that my sister is not 100% my sister &amp; we don’t have the same father &amp; we both have been lied to about that our entire lives by our mother who I also don’t have the best relationship with. We did DNA tests two days ago for absolute concrete evidence of everything so now it’s a waiting game. I live in the same house as her &amp; have been dying to get out on my own but financially am unable to at the moment due to my own disability cystic fibrosis.

3. The girl I have been in a situation-ship doesn’t feel the same way I do about her. This one hurts me so much, honestly more in a sense than my dad passing. I feel like I’m mourning the loss of someone still alive but we are still friends &amp; love one another. I never thought I’d catch feelings for her but here we are. We have a beautiful friendship , the sex is great &amp; we have so many great laughs &amp; moments. She’s been such a bright spot in my dark times lately. I wanted to see if we could give things a real try but she just doesn’t feel how I do. This now is breaking my heart &amp; don’t know how to navigate it. I don’t want to just get rid of her as a friend, I genuinely care about her. She is fine with continuing what we are doing but I’m not sure I can do that right now with how I feel about her. 

Everything is just compounding ontop of eachother &amp; I feel like I’m suffocating. My appetite is shot, I feel restless where I feel like I’m going crazy &amp; I’ve been having very dark thoughts &amp; find humor in self harm jokes to myself &amp; my close friends.

"nsfw trigger warning:my whole life i have fantasized about the idea of dying. i met death once, it was a dark and quiet place, and i experienced what it truly was to be alone. expect this alone did not hurt, in fact it was relieving. so relieving that when i when i opened my eyes again i cursed every nurse and doctor who thought it necessary to save me. i, at the age of 11, decided that i no longer needed saving from the mess that i called life, i wanted to return to that darkness. i truly wanted to die. and with every year that i grew older, i fell more in love with closing my eyes for the final time. 11 years later i sit at the door of another birthday, another reminder that i am alive. a burden. a curse. what could i do the expire naturally? nothing, no disease i have or could possibly have would kill me any time soon. it is a matter i now have to deal with personally. suicide. suicide is such a scary word to utter. but not just because i am afraid of dying. i am. i am terrified. almost as terrifying as choosing the wrong number in an almost winning lotto ticket. if i go, would i possibly be missing a reason to live? but everyday the possibility of that seems unlikely, almost silly. suicide. i attend to commit suicide. i attend to revisit that quiet darkness and make it my home, a place where i can finally belong. to close my eyes and know that i can finally breath and be relieved of trying. today, maybe tomorrow, or maybe i can hold out a little longer, but eventually my only plan is to rely on suicide and finish what was started 11 years ago. today i made a decision",Suicidal

"I met someone on Hinge about eight months ago and we got along instantly which is extremely rare for me. We could not meet in person at the time due to lockdown restrictions. It started like any online dating relationship starts, with flirting and asking questions and getting to know one another. All of a sudden he stopped showing interest. That really affected my already low self-esteem and I tried my best to talk to him and figure out why he lost interest. I came across as cold and scary, he became very defensive, it got quite bad and I had quite a severe panic attack that took five propanolol to sort out. I blamed myself and he reluctantly came back, he would be even colder and more distant now. No more good mornings or how are yous, no flirting, no questions, nothing. Just very short superficial talks about current events or interests. I tried to ask him in a more direct way why he was behaving like that and it resulted in him ignoring me. I gave up and deleted him off all social media (except the one we used for messaging) and moved on with my life. Two months later he messages me saying how much he misses me and wants to rectify things. Nobody has ever come back for me, it meant a lot. We start talking again, nothing gets rectified he just repeats himself whilst ignoring and not apologizing for how he behaved. But I am just happy he is back so I let it be. We finally meet and it goes somewhat well, he does not flirt but he seems interested again. Fast forward to our 5th date and we sleep together. Afterwards he just goes back to being distant despite always being online. It makes me extremely overwhelmed and I go talk to him. I am ignored until he replies about how he cannot take it anymore and how it is not his fault work was busy. I mentioned how affection or at least signs of interest are and he was having none of it. Ultimately I blamed myself and explained my current family situation as it also affects me to maybe make him understand that I just really needed some support and he ignored me for days. I would avoid messaging him but I would always see him online. I asked him for closure as I did not know what do he replied instantly, said it was a shame as we were so compatible and that if I wanted we could still be friends. When I replied that if we both tried it could work, he ignored me again. The day after I went for a day out on the beach and saw a little stall that does clam chowder which I have never tried before meeting him and it is one of his fav foods, when I got home I messaged him saying that I wanted to take him there to show him something even if just as friends. He ignored me again. The day afterwards (which was yesterday) I had a job interview. I have been trying really hard these past years to finally have my own life. I have been through therapy, medication and regularly study and follow well-being advice. Currently, I live with my mom - who has her own set of mental health problems lately she is been well but at times she becomes awful towards me. Especially if I show emotions, the worst ones are if I cry or seem angry (even if I am not, if she thinks I am then that is an invitation to start a fight) - and my cat - who is dying of lymphoma. I am an immigrant so I do not have many friends here. Most of my friends are from work but lately everybody is too busy for me. So this job interview meant a lot. If I get this, I may very well be able to afford to live in my own place. In the hype of the interview, I made a decision to move on and have a fresh start. New job, then new house, new life. And I was tired of feeling so overwhelmed and weighed down by everything and now being given false hope. So I messaged a final time, stating this could have all been sorted within a day. How it is impossible to form any relationship with someone who simply is not there. I then deleted him off the messaging app we use and his number. He has not attempted to communicate but it is not as if I am expecting it. I do not think I am wrong. I think that if he wanted to this could work. What affects me is why is it that nobody ever wants to at least try to make it work? I am willing to compromise, I have always hyped him up and showed him that he matter to me. Every morning I would wish him a good morning despite knowing I would not receive one back, the same would happen at night. So what is it about me that so damn disgusting that does not even deserve a good morning? I am afraid to cry under my own roof. I have absolutely nobody in this world and the only creature on this planet that somehow loves me is going to die soon. I cannot trust anyone because of the amount of times I have been bullied, rejected, belittled, used, harmed. I have attempted suicide twice before so I know this third time I would not fail, plus three times the charm. The only thing keeping me here is waiting to hear back from the interview and how bitterly disappointing it is that now, after my entire life spent trying to overcome trauma and abuse, when I am finally getting where I want, someone appears and completely kills any crumb of love I had for myself just by not bothering to be there. After a half-ghosted ""relationship"" ended I have been thinking about suicide for the past days",Suicidal

"Is it okay to appear rude to others? I find it extremely anxiety inducing to be disliked, and appearing rude or non caring elicits this reaction from others.

The funny thing is, I am continually, day after day, in my attempts not to appear this way, am this way. I don't give solid eye contact to others, mere glances, I hide myself away in plain sight with poor, meek body language, I carry myself without confidence to avoid interactions.

All in vain attempts of appearing, in my delusional mind, 'nice'. It is so self destructive, you essentially let people walk over you, ignore you, in some desire to be liked. By people who dislike you, will come to dislike you as a result of your behaviours, or simply horrible people who you wouldn't want to like you. 

Let me give an example, of what I'm thinking. 

You're shopping for groceries, you want to look at a shelf which is currently occupied by someone else, you need something on that shelf, like a tin of food or something. Usually I will see this and think 'oh my god, don't want them to know I need something there' heavens forbid if they see me, what will they think? So I quickly change direction and pretend to look at other items until they move.
So, instead, why not stand in their shadow, and wait patiently, let your presence be seen, in an ideal world, ask them to make space if you know exactly what you need but that would come when you're more confident? So yes, stand next to them, and don't budge, just let them know non verbally, you're waiting.

Another example, you're at the cashier, they're doing your items, I always look everywhere but where I need to look, I lose focus on what I should be looking at, which is the items I'm paying for, the cashiers eyes in case they're trying to communicate something. And what if they say something, small talk for instance, well maybe I'm not in the mood to pursue further small talk, so why not just give closed answers, why do I feel the need to fill the silences, to say whatever I can to appear 'normal'. I come across as flustered, shy, unconfident, I see it in their faces, they see the fear, they see the disgust on my face believing I'm a wrongin or something but it's really just negativity brewing inside of me of being in such a anxiety inducing situation that causes these expressions on my face, then they mirror it. And I think awful things about myself. 
So why not stay calmer, speak slower, not try and have a positive small talk experience, just take things at my own pace. Otherwise I leave feeling utterly embarrassed, ashamed, and the next time I shop there and there my cashier they're going to hate that I'm there. As opposed to being more stoic and less nervously chatty.

I'm rambling a bit, losing focus on my words, sorry but some of that probably doesn't make sense. I hope you get the type of rude I'm talking about. It's not purposefully being rude. It's more, being true to yourself, being comfortable in your own body and standing up to be counted as an equal. Something I avoid.

I have Bipolar (I was diagnosed as BP2 but after an illness earlier in the year I feel like I may have had a manic episode over the summer, but we'll see what the doctor thinks) as well as ADHD. The mood stabilizers help, but don't do a whole lot for concentration while the ADHD meds work for concentration but make me, you know, *manic.*

"I am 25F. I was diagnosed with depression at 12, and borderline personality disorder at 23. It comes and goes, but when its bad its BAD. Things are not going amazing in my life at the moment, but also not particularly bad, either. But i feel like I am in a serious slump.I have tried therapy multiple times in the last 13 years, multiple different therapists and approaches but it honestly has never done anything for me at all.I have been on SO many different medications throughout the years, and finally am on one that helps more than the others, but still not fully. Nobody in my family deals with any mood disorders, so they are not very understanding when i do go through slumps, so i feel like I am not taken seriously and no one truly understands how bad i feel.I also do not want to try therapy again for the simple fact that i cannot afford it. I make too much for Medicaid, and even with good insurance i was paying almost $300 out of pocket, twice a month, just for therapy alone, not including my general appointments for my medication.I really only have 3 people i can talk to. One being my boyfriend of 6 years, who is supportive and as helpful as he can be, but given the fact hes never struggled with it himself, he does not really understand. The other is my best friend who is honestly not the greatest friend in general, and i feel like i bother her when i talk to her. The last person is my sister, but she picks and chooses when she wants to listen/help.I hate burdening people with my issues, and i feel that is all i do.

"I was bullied like almost everyone else and ever since life was different. I always thought there was a pre-defined mindset that I had to get myself to believe in to be happy (like ''I do not care what others think etc.). But that is bullshit, affirmations do not work and they will never work, because they do not change anything in your life.Everything somebody else can do for you is give you an explanation on why your brain is the way it is. There are no supplements, Affirmations, meditations, drugs, Therapies that will make a significant change.If you do not physically change something in your life everything will stay the same.Being bullied left me in an unconsciouss shame state that followed me everywhere. what is the easiest and most reliable way to live with Trauma? Coping strategies. My coping strategies were Videogames and social media.The bad thing in your life are not the circumstances, its how you react to them. Lock them up, cope them away with addictions, perform compulsions, evade them at any cost will never ever change something.Be clever and start recognising what your coping strategies are and just do not commit to them anymore. No affirmations necessary, your brain will sort things through by itself.Coping strategies are basically everything that make you feel good immediately (your smartphone, food, drugs...). If you do not try to stop your coping then you are not allowed to ask for help in my eyes because you should know what to do.How can you heal in circumstances that made you that way?You will notice that your life might get very silent, even lonely. But that is just the demons you locked away. You will learn to regulate your emotions again. Shame is the Key emotion why mental illness is so prevalent nowadays. This is how the sequence usually goes:Trauma-&gt;Shame-&gt;coping strategies-&gt;addictions-&gt;depression, ocd, anxiety, borderline, extreme narcissm... What your mental illness will be in the end depends on the person, some might get ocd and do compulsive information seeking, some might become grandiose narcissists and completely ignore their problem and just make it their daily life to get affirmation from others on social media.that is the thing about self esteem: It does not need a reason.Narcissism always needs a reason, mostly multiple times a day a. What does your brain need its emotional regulation for if you perform instant reward coping strategies instead? If you are as desperate as I was, you should take my advice seriously. It will not be enjoyable but that is what life is like.What if instant rewards would have been accessible in ancient times? The people would not have evolved and would probably have died because nobody wants to work for long term goals if there are instant rewards. Everyone is responsible for their own mental health.Get off the internet, use it only for important things. Buy an old Phone without internet. Move out of your parents house if you have not already.

"Once I had depression 3 years ago, the reason I wanted to kill myself was because suicide was the only way to get out of the pain that I was fighting. Nowadays, things have changed. I want to live and avoid pain but I must kill myself because I found that I am the very person that meets conditions of a man whom I want to kill.There are several things that help me realize that I must kill myself, but in summary, it is because I could have been a better person in any aspectbetter job, better human relationship, more money, and a lot morebut I have not tried and I will not try. 3 years ago I compared myself to others(mostly my schoolmates who already graduated and got jobs), but now I compare myself to 'the better me' that I could have been. The counselor I met when I got depression for the first time told me to compare myself to 'the worse me' in the past rather than others; but it seems like to work in the wrong way.One major symptom is that I call myself as a third person in my brain. When I swear at myself I do not think like 'Why am I such a shitty ass' but 'Why is John Doe such a shitty ass'. Feels quite weird, when someone insults me and that guy is also me. Of course it is painful. And logically, I have no reason to stop swearing because my father told me not to harm others and I am not one in that 'others' so swearing at myself is not harming others. Not blaming my father tho, for he is the best man I know. I am just abusing his lesson.Of course I have a dream of a happy life in my own way. This is what throws me into a deeper pain because every time I dream of it I found that I will not be able to get.As I wrote in the title I do not want to die and I know that no one truly wants to die.

"So many posts I have read from teens and 20 year olds wanting to end it. It makes me sad. I was there, and we really have no idea how little of the world we seen. And how hopeless it really is not (for the most part). I have managed to make it this far. But I am not entirely sure I am supposed to go much further. I never saw myself getting ""old"" and maybe this is why.I ran away when I was 16. Dad left when I was five, my mom was an alcoholic and had two more kids with a married man. She died three years ago. I have had a hard childhood...blah blah blahEver since I left home I have been fighting for a better life. I believe life is choices. You wake up and choose to be better then your past. You recognize what is right and wrong and know how it feels to be bullied and not loved and demeaned, so you choose to act the opposite, embrace people and be there for friends because you know what it is like to be alone and you do not want anyone to feel like that, like this. Things are supposed to get better. I am now 43. I have worked two jobs my entire life until I turned 40 and mentally could not take it anymore. I have not been on vacation in over 20 years. I have student loan debt. do not go to college, it is a scam.Last year I was laid off from March until January due to Covid. I had to move. All my savings is gone. I have $20 in my bank account. I am tired. I am supposed to return to work in August, September at the latest. The last three weeks I have thought about death. Have written my note in my head over and over. They say money cannot buy happiness, but it can buy relief. When you do not know how you are going to pay your rent and bills it gets overwhelming every...single... day.I see so many posts about people having good jobs and money and husbands and wives and kids. People who have a ""good life""; but you still want to die? there is no help. I am not ready yet. I still cry when I think of it, but I am not scared to do it. I am just not ready yet. But the thoughts come more and more and I do not think it will be too long. I am trying to memorize things...how things feel, smell, and look. Subtle differences that we take for granted every day or miss. Like how someone is eyes light up or how a smile spreads across someone is face.So, my younger ones, think about your life. See the beauty in what you have. You have so much a head of you and there is much joy in this world. Love yourself.
