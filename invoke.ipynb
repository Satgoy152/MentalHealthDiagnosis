I had a very complicated childhood, my parents never let me get an education. (and by that I mean not at all, I never did any school work, or even went to school at all when I was a kid/teen.)my spelling is almost nonexistent and no matter how hard I try I cannot seem to improve it (using a mix of autocorrect/google translate to write this out) and my math is awful, but I did manage to teach myself to read quite well though.I was not allowed to talk to other kids growing up and so I had no friends growing up and was not allowed to leave the house at all, only sometimes to go shopping with my dad or mom. and I went out even less after my father killed himself when I was 8.the first time I talked to someone/went outside by myself was when I was 16 and it was to get milk and other stuff because my mom just got too lazy and she could not be bothered anymore I suppose. as you probably guessed I have extreme social anxiety and can barely talk to other people even till this day.this might sound awful and I feel awful for saying this, but covid is probably the best thing to ever happen to me I was able to move out with one of my sisters because of government benefits, because of this I was able to look inward and able to see how badly I was treated by my family and to see that I might have a lot of mental problems because of this.I do not know how I thought my home life was normal, but I had my mom calling me useless because I was unable to get a job and pay her rent, and most of my siblings treated me like dirt acting grossed out just from seeing me, and some of them even used to tell me that: I should kill myself because no one would miss me anyway\".the only people in my family I am close with are my two little sisters and my older brother though he cut everyone in our family off including me because his wife does not like any of us which hit me hard.my family has pretty much fallen apart a surprise to anyone reading this I am sure haha.so that brings us to today I am 23 years old have no education, do not have any friends, I cannot get a job, and I Might be homeless soon.I am seeing a psychologist soon. I do not think it will help me much honestly. I wake up every day scared of being homeless I cannot relax anymore, I do not enjoy anything in life anymore. for anyone who is worried I do not think I am suicidal, but I am honestly finding it hard to find a reason to live anymore.to anyone who made it to the end of this probably very badly spelled post, Thank you.

I had cancer when I was younger and my doctors think I just have health anxiety, or neuropathy from old chemo (which is uncommon) anyways i got a new doctor and she scared me more because she told me “it doesnt sound like full blown MS but i can do some tests” basically even though she said it didnt sound like it, she still didnt rule it out. that was enough to scare me into a spiraling panic. I google my symptoms every day, read up On MS and i’m fully convinced i have it. I even posted on the MS forum here but now I wonder if it could all just be anxiety. I’m terrified.

      "Query: Hi, I hope that you are okay.I am not, unfortunately. Its the second depressive episode of my life, and idk if Ill survive this one.I have abandonment trauma and each time a separation occurs, I get depressed. The more attached, the worse.My first episode happened 4 years ago and was due to leaving high school and my home town.My therapist, my family and friends helped me through. But the one who helped me the most was my boyfriend. I always thought that I would never meet a guy like those in books. And yet I did. The second we started talking I knew he was special. How odd a feeling.During three years and a half I grew better alongside him. I started loving life in its smallest forms like insect and seeds, learnt almost everything I know about nature and started caring about myself to take better care of others. If there is anything such as soulmates in this world, he is mine. Yet due to that covid nightmare and my failing at passing a specific exam, we have lived apart since March 2020, and he could not bear it. I have not been the best GF in a distance relationship since I have a strong sense of imagination which made me feel like he was with me in the new city I lived in, and the discrepancy between our dealing with distance cost us our story. Ever since our breakup 4 months ago, my life has been nothing but a nightmarish roller coaster which does not provide any fun at all. The worse in that is that I know that he will not be willing to try again for as long as I am in that state (which no one would, this is the healthy logical thing to do), and I do not know how to get out of that state without him.It is not that I need his help to get better, but rather that our being apart hurts way too much. And now that my grandad is about to die, I am seriously wondering how I will not go even more berserk and completely ruin my last chances of getting back with him. I am seeing therapists, taking meds, doing the things that I love (activism, reading, writing and drawing, playing music), seeing my friends and family and even opening up to new relationships and flirting with cute guys. Yet nothing helps. I am feeling more depressed than ever. Sorry for the long sad and useless talk. Yet if anyone has any kind of pieces of advice to give me, Id truly appreciate it. Take care &lt;3 Life feels like the worst of a rollercoaster and a haunted house combined.\n",

      "Query: Self-Fulfilling Prophesy: *The sociopsychological phenomenon of someone \"predicting\" or expecting something, and this \"prediction\" or expectation coming true simply because the person believes it will and the person's resulting behaviors align to fulfill the belief.*I have a lot of anxiety about the upcoming immigration to from Russia to Israel, where my parents live now, and I have been feeling afraid that I would be denied entry after I have done all the work they asked. I have been chatting about it with my gaming friends for a while, which would calm the nerves a bit. But I have been feeling angry at my gaming friends today. We used to be tight when I was in the you.S. being in the same time zone made it easier to play games together than it does now. Our little group helped us get through the pandemic, as we would get online every night and play PUBG, Apex, Destiny, and many other games we tried over the year. And our little group grew - first it was just the three of us, now it is seven. We also knew most of each other IRL, so we would hang out at a bar or play D&amp;D together.When I moved back to Russia in April, I used to ask them every day if they will be on, because I have got no other socializing going on for me except for family. Every day I would wake up at 7 AM on my time just to speak with my friends. I would spend a couple of hours with them, before they would peel off to sleep, and then spend the rest of the day anxious about immigration.But as the time went on, I started to get less and less responses. I would ask in our chat if people were planning to be online in the evening while it was still morning over there, just to make sure that everyone got to reply. Also, so I would get ample time to see their answers, to know when I should wake up. Initially I would get many confirmations, then less and less, then people stopped answering consistently. Eventually I would feel lucky if I got so much as a no. The distance separated us. Over time they have become busier with jobs picking up after COVID mandates lifted, with new partners, just life. I however, regressed: I am alone (or more accurately, feeling alone), I got no job, I separated with a girlfriend of 7 years, because the distance and the uncertainty of whether I am coming back to America and when, made our relationship impossible. Chronic depression became more consistent. I started to realize that I was angry at them for moving on, for finding people closer to them to spend time around, for hanging out together without me. I started blaming myself for feeling angry and upset that I was not getting the socializing I needed. I have had my depressive episodes and they have offered support over chat, which was a nice gesture. But I realized that I was angry because they said, They were there for me, except the times when I needed them. I cannot blame them for not noticing that me asking if people are online in the evening is a cry for help. That I am desperate for human contact other than my family members that I am forced to live with because I have nothing else in Russia. That I feel alone in a crowded room.I feel lonely. I feel unwanted. I feel unattractive. I feel like I am nobody. I feel like I have got nothing to offer. I feel let down because I have let myself down.I had a dream about living in the you.S. till the day I die.I LOVED living in the you.S.I feel like I have let myself down because I had not fought harder for my right to be there. Because I have not explored more options for stay. Because I did not participate in the Green Card lottery consistently. Because I did not save money to go to Grad School. Because I did not confront the Executive Director of the facility I worked at as a Counselor when he denied my request for a work visa, which they did sponsor for past employees.During these 8 years I have learned the language almost to perfection, I got a college degree, I have worked, I have got a B.A. in Psychology, I worked again, I asked, politely to let me work longer. I did everything right. And it was still not enough.In my academic life I have felt like I was barely passing, that I was procrastinating and not doing enough. I feel like I do not deserve both of my degrees. In my work life I feel that I was lucky I got my job and that I did not deserve it. That I was not doing more than I possibly could, even though some days I would work for 15 hours straight during a pandemic, ears red from the facemask loops, then falling into my bed half-dead, after driving home for an hour, so that I could be up in another two to do it all over again.And still I feel let down because I believe I let myself get kicked out of the you.S.And now I sit in the apartment in Russia, struggling to send out the paperwork for the Israeli immigration, because I am afraid, I am going to fail at that too. I choose not to act because I do not want to disappoint myself again. And it will come true, because knowing all of this is not enough motivation for me to do something about it.So, all I got left is the feeling of anger at the people who cannot play with me no more.

      "Query: I am not shure if this is the right sub for this but i have to write this down somewhere.I am a 18 year old male avererage reddit user from Germany.About a year ago I wanted to upgrade my Pc and accidently broke it. The problem in having summer vacation, close to no friends and being unable to do your two only hobbies is you have time to think, A LOT of time to think. After about two weeks of doing nothing except of thinking about my past actions and reflecting about my current state of having about 1-2 friends (ig I am still not shure what a friend really is, where do you draw the line?), severly performing under my possibilities and nearly failing my Abitur (Highschool) my mood went downwards fast. After 4 weeks when I finally got my parts to fix the PC the damage was already done. On a daily basis my mood got worse, over time I enjoyed my hobbies less and less, got less talk active (which you can see on this post I usually do a lot) and ate less and less to the point of loosing about 10kg in one week (which is unhealthy but I am overweight so its not that big of a deal) because everything tasted bland anyways and I felt empty anyways. I noticed early where that is going to go but was shure after the last/final school trip in which i had basically a breakdown once a day. I kept going anyways because I did not want anyone to worry but at the same time I wanted exactly that I wanted to see that people actually care about me, not because they had to because they are related or care about everyone, I wanted to see if somebody actually noticed that I am not okay and not just moody. Spoiler: nobody did, apart from maybe my teacher that noticed that i basically went from the most active student in the course to the least active. I cried almost every day. Nobody noticed my mom just thought i wanted to loose weight. My 18th birthday was about that time, I wanted to skip it both my parents (divorced) did not allow it. So i had two partys one with my mom, my aunt and my best friend and one with my dad, gradparents, brother, and my dads patchwork family. Both were stressing me out strongly, all human interaction was hard, I wanted to appear kind of ok even though the suicidal thoughts slowly crawled in my head more and more. I still hoped anybody notices. A few weeks later i was so instable that a simple test in school basically broke me to the point of not even being able to uphold my facade in school. that is where I drew the line, I cannot wait anymore for somebody to help, if I will not help myself now I would possibly do something really stupid later. I went to my doctor. I expected to get told I was overreacting and should calm down. My doctor took me very serious, he calmed me down took some test to check if there was a non hormonal because and prescribed me antidepressants and wrote me sick for the day and tge day after (it was thursday and the second lockdown was the week after anyways). That day was the worst, i basically had to tell my mostly oblivious relatives that I was depressed and i had to decide if I would actually use the drugs I had gotten. After talking with my parents and people I knew I came to the conclusion that I have no real alternativ than taking them. I found a psychologist about 1-2months later way faster than I expected. After about half a year of sucessful medication and therapy my psychologist said they are thinking I would not need therapy anymore, I agreed. I talked to my doctor and quit the meds. I finished school with a grade better than expected. I thought it was over it.But the whole time I knew the only goal I had in finding somebody who cared was unfulfilled. I have not found one person that cared about me, I had to get myself out of there even though that was the only thing i wanted not to do. It haunts me. I had two medium breakdowns this week. I am am fucking scared. I do not want to be depressed again, I cannot go through that shit again. I do not know what to do anymore. Everything turned out fine why am I going down the same fucking road i went about a year ago? Why do I feel like I am not even worth getting cared about? I can study what I want everything went far better than expected why tf is my mood getting worse? I just do not know anymore. I do not know anymore\n",

      "Query: During high school I would cry pretty much every single day when I got back home. I was going through horrible low moods, my sleep schedule was incredibly messed up and I would just want to sleep and stay in bed when possible. I had no drive or motivation for anything, but I just continued with the routine of daily life and what is expected of a high school student. At the time I did not really realise I was depressed, I thought it was just a rough patch that would hopefully stop one day. I knew I was exhibiting symptoms of depression but I never really thought this is depression and I am depressed as though there were something wrong with me mentally, and that it all lied with me as an individual and my character.I then got into University and hoped for a fresh start. I had a decent time there and socially had no problems, but I myself as an individual was still pretty much depressed and struggled academically. This significantly increased my stress and at times my depression and throughout University, I never really had the opportunity to have a pure break because I would have to study throughout the holidays. Whilst I had multiple break downs throughout, I do not think it was as bad as during school.Done with University and back with my family, because I wanted to take a small break from everything. I used to have a lot of problems with my parents, particularly with my mother and my moving back was most probably not best for my mental health. Again, almost like at school, I would cry quite regularly and feel incredibly low with no drive or motivation. Went through two years of horrible fights with them but ultimately, I believe I have finally managed to patch things up with my mother. We most probably have the best relationship right now than we have had for the past 10 years. At that time, I realised that I have been pretty much depressed since high school, driven by my relationship with my parents. I still hold negative feelings towards them sometimes, but we r both working to being better with each other. I got back to University but still am with my family. With the pandemic, I am stuck at home most of the time. I am extremely introverted and honestly relish the time where I am completely alone. However, being at home with studies and my family has been quite stressful and throughout the past year, the stress has been continuously building up. My parents mental health had also been struggling with the pandemic and as I have pretty much since I was a kid, I would support them a lot during these times. This also subtly contributed to my stress. I had not managed to have an actual break, (though I do have long periods of stress induced procrastination) and eventually I messed something up a month ago and had a horrible break down, like the ones I had during the worst of my times back during my old University or school years. I felt like this time, I ridiculously felt the physical effects of stress and depression, and really felt like they could kill me. For what has been pretty much a decade of depression, bad sleep and poor coping skills with stress, I have experienced physical symptoms like pain. But right now, I feel like its all building up to the point of boiling over (or it already has). I am repeating the same cycle of procrastination, self hate, not recovering from feeling horrible and stressed, even though I really do try to go to sleep earlier or exercise/go out for walks. I really do not need to socialise with people and I do maintain decent contact with my friends. I feel depressed pretty much 24/7 when I am not distracting myself with music, media entertainment, socialising. I cannot focus on my studies at all and I am just so tired. I have been tired for a decade and I just do not know what to do anymore. I always tell myself that one day it just will not be like this, but I am exhausted, drained and no matter how much I rest I just feel horrible. I do not know what to do anymore.

      "Query: If you read the title read it once again.What I am saying below is depressing but it is not a lie.Does anyone feel like they are never living in the present, I sure do. I live my life chasing hopes and solving problems I have mostly caused myself, trying to better myself everyday and becoming someone I should be in my own mind. But there is always that thought that everything could end in a matter of seconds and I know that is very possible to happen.So that leaves me with this mission I feel I will never solve, if I am chasing all these dreams and always trying to become someone I want to be. What does that make of myself today. Would I ever be at peace in death if it were to happen today? Or would i be on my mission still, trying to become the perfect version of my self which in my head has existed many times. But yet I would always judge my own thoughts and feel like I should do 'better' even when I have reached a goal that I once visioned to be the perfect me.I chase and I chase, I feel purpose in being something more than I am every single day, I tell myself I am not happy or i will never be at peace until I fulfil these visions. But each vision I see and claim I still feel the fucking same way, one thing ends and its on to the next to fulfil myself as the last vision was nothing more than a stepping stone in my own mind. It leaves me with the question that has surfaced during every vision I have ever had and that is would I be happy if I were to die today? Or would I be worthless as I never took the steps I told myself to do. Ill be fucking honest if you have related to what I just said it can only end one way, that way I have figured out today. The way it ends is in helpless hope for happiness and fulfilment, to reach the perfect version of yourself to be someone that you have dreamt of which will only be a fragment of the life you once lived, nothing more than energy from your own mind. Nothing to anyone else, nothing to yourself. Sure as hell nothing to the future of this world. We are here because we were born to be, lead upon a life of confusion and misled instructions. To be a 'human' the only species that could ever think and do for themselves as far as we know. Alone on this world and on a mission to become a superior race. To dominate this earth to conquer our solar systems. To become gods at the end of it all as far as I know in my own head.But that will not happen for a very long fucking time, all we are today is hurdles, paths forged by our own thoughts to lead us hopefully to a blissful fairytale of immortality, where we could all live with our loved ones and remember the best times of our lives for an eternity.The problem with that is that we are never living our best times because we are chasing and chasing our better selves to bring peace. Which is ultimately pain in the end.So to end all of this my final mission is to tell all of you that life is nothing, nothing more than a figment of your mind, nothing more than fake instructions to be what you are. At the end of everything you are alone, lifeless and empty, nothing more than a past present to the future and what will the future be? The same fucking same thing.We are all here to live and die. Everything single thing along the way may bring the slightest and I mean slighted change to the future of life. The rest of it is just a delusional thought you have created to feel some sort of peace in your life until you reach the end where you hope, hope to be in a fucking dream world Knowing all this makes me feel numb, worthless and non existent and if you have related to what I just said you would feel the same. But that is very likely to be what this life is. There is nothing else along the way other than false hopes and sad endings, I am sorry for myself for having to be here and I am sorry for everyone else that is on the same ride with me. We wish we were more but that is beyond us. This is the dark truth of the world. It revolves around energy and we are just feeding it until it ends its own fate.So enjoy the ride, fulfil every hope you have and never stop doing so as I am sure it will make this easier. If you cannot stop changing yourself the world will simply do that for you. Which is being in death before you are dead. The way I feel about life.

Tiny musical note tattoo that’s on my face to hire me. Then new manager comes thru and I’m gone same day. Cause it’s company policy no facial or hand tattoos. I have both. They still hired me and I was told many times in their hardest worker. Anyway. Along with that my moms sick she has a few terminal illnesses. And I don’t have any friends anymore cause I got fired. No one has even asked how I’m doing of those ex coworkers. I have a job interview today. But I can’t get out of this funk like I cannot get out of my own head that this is just what I deserve for the things I did when I was younger. I just deserve to suffer and somewhat loath myself. I kicked a drug habit and moved and yea being sober is actually awesome. But, being lonely like so lonely that I got love money scammed out of most of my savings. That desperation of wanting just a friend just not to be alone forever. Not to hate every thing about myself everyday when I wake up and have to look myself in the mirror. If this breaks rules I apologize I read them and didn’t see anything bad about this post. I just need help I don’t know what to do anymore. I also have other disorders and circumstances that make me getting this help much much more difficult.\n",

My boyfriend who works with me pointed out that I wasn’t acting normal after I had already kind of noticed the elevated mood myself. I was trying not to fixate on it but once he pointed it out it started making me very anxious. \n",

In particular, there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with.

I am so in love with him and I cannot do it. I told my mom and she said I need to feel my emotions but let it go so I can focus on school. We broke up 9 hours ago. 9 hours and all I am to my mom is an opportunity to brag. My emotions do not matter. Nobody cares about me. I cannot close my eyes because i can feel him kissing and caressing my face. I cannot sleep because i can feel him next to me. I cannot do anything because everything reminds me of him. I feel so dumb. I am hoping for a miracle that will not come. I was deep in my depression before we got together and it feels like all 7 months are tumbling down on top of me and I feel like shit. I love him. So much. So fucking much. I do not know what happens after death. that is what kept me alive for so long. My fear of what happens after death saved me so many times; but right now I really do not know if it can. I want to stop hurting. I want to get away from my responsibilities. I hope that after death there is some way I can at least imagine we are still together, and I do not have to worry about school, or careers, or anything. I do not want to feel this way anymore.

But its wrong, and I do not want to get better.I am so used to the familiarity of it. There was a certain amount of comfort to those feelings of numb-emptiness, or just plain heaviness. I had my low times, I self-harmed, and it sorta got better for a week before going downhill, the cycle repeating 2 weeks after. It was reliable. It was known. It made the highs feel better.But for a few months now, I have been, by most views, improving. I have less depressive episodes. It went from 3 weeks to 5 to 8. The sadness behind the self-harm is fading, and as it does, the strength of temptations grows weaker.And yet, I cling to what remains. I am not ready to get better. I am not ready to lose the comfort of harming. The depression is part of who I am at this point, and I do not know how to live without it. Perhaps because my depression never had a clear because, there is no closure, nothing in my life has improved to justify or explain me getting better.I am here because my partner suggested I ask if anyone else has experience with this.

I have also had an easier time making friends and getting dates through online apps. However I noticed I still do not trust any of these people, because I always remember deep down when I needed help the most and someone to just talk to, the only help I got was myself, so I am jaded because I do not trust people to be there for me anymore, not when I really need them. I just wanted advice, how do I overcome this cynicism, even therapy has not been helping with it. 27 M that got his depression under wrap after many years but still slightly traumatized and distrustful because the only person that got me through it was me.\n",

I am 27, a single mom to an 19 month old, currently living with my parents, going through parental court. I take 100 % care of my son.I get up at 6 in the morning, rain or shine, no matter if I have had a panic attack the night before. I tend to my son every needs, I play, I read, I take him on walks and when he goes to bed around 7/8 I go to bed too, and I am asleep by 10.I am currently on sick leave due to PTSD, I stayed home with my son till march, and now I have 6 hours all alone every day except the weekends. I just spend my days,relaxing, napping some days, cleaning and getting back up on my feet. I went through PND/PNA and PPD/PPA (pregnancy/postpartum anxiety+depression), my PTSD went to shits and my eating disorder blossomed again. So its been hard, and since I NEED to put my son first that is what I have done, and now I have the time to put myself first during the daytime. And for me its working.I got no social life, well I talk a bit to the neighbours and parents in kindergarten, but I do not meet up with my friends. I do not date, I just focus on me and my son, and I do not feel lonely or anything just as a bit of a failure at times. Its hard being a mom on my worst days, I do not want to get up from bed but I have to, getting outside to the playground is also hard but I do it.I feel like I am putting in so much hard work, but when my mom talks down on me tells me to cut the crap and my life is miserable, I am starting to think that it might be.From I was 8 and up until now everything has been utter shit, but I am contempt, I am in a good place even though I am struggeling. My PPD has lifted alot and I love my son so so much, and I have been waiting for the whole motherly feeling and now that its here I just want to stay in this bubble. I am working hard to be the mama my son needs, and that means I do not do much social and during the day. But its working for me.Before I had my son I was social,I was out and about, I worked, I was doing 110 % and it made me even more sick. Now I do things at my pace, I am working on showering,brushing my teeth and all that jazz, I do not want to slip up and end up in my dark hole again.

The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life.

      "Query: I have been very active here recently but having somewhere to vent, somewhere where I do not feel alone makes the feeling alot easier on me I guess. This is not entirely related to the post, I just wanted to express my appreciation for this subreddit. Its helped me alot.That being said I just saw a post on here, someone talking about being \"snapped out of it\" because they realized how much it would hurt their kid and it made me think about why I have not done it yet.My two brothers. One older than me and one younger than me. The older one tells me all the time that when I was born it snapped him out of suicide. His attempts were stopped by me crying as a baby, or even when I annoyed him he still loved me and wanted to stick around to see me happy or even just to annoy me. My younger brother has never expressed the desire to kill himself to me before, like I did to my older brother brother; but I have similar reasons. Truthfully, I like to fuck with him. Sometimes the funniest part of my day is me walking into his room, flicking his forehead and walking out. he is one of the funniest people I know and I know my death would ruin him. I have two sisters, neither if them are super in my life so I do not know for sure how my death would impact them but it helps to think they would be devastated too. I have a niece. she is a year and 7 months old and she is the cutest thing to exist. She cannot talk but I love my moments of communication with her. We play games together even though she cannot speak. Some sort of variation of simon says where she waves her arms and claps her hands wanting me to copy her. Sometimes she will turn of the tv when I am watching and look at me and laugh at me. Sometimes she does things and when I tell her to stop she looks at me and does it anyway. I want to see her grow up. she is so smart right now and I love how she is right now and I want to see her get older and I want to tell her stories about right now and show her videos of how she liked to just fuck with her aunt or how she would kiss her reflection.Sometimes this does not work. Sometimes I relish in the feeling that if I did commit suicide right now, people would be devastated. Sometimes I feel like that is the only time I will be loved by everyone unconditionally, and I feel like at my funeral, when it finally sets in, everyone will realize what they did wrong and feel remorse. Sometimes I think that if I died right now maybe in the afterlife I will have everything I want, including what makes me happy now. Maybe if I just did it I could have my cake and eat it too.This is a hard reason to have, because sometimes its my reason for wanting to kill myself and sometimes its my reason for staying alive. I want a better reason. I wish this was not my only reason but its kept me here for 9 years. Maybe if I had a better reason, the 9 years would finally be over and I could just live and be happy but for now I guess it will do. I wish I could find a better reason but if it works it works I guess.\n",

As of now there are around 15 people who have come and gone which I seen since the first day I joined and worked here up until now. I heard that this business has been running for 4-5 years now but from what I seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do as they have tutoring, selling board games/blind boxes and even large figurine tradings, throwing menial tasks at every employee with focus on trying to get more employees to join. I worked around 11-12 hours on average so it makes me stressed at first.\n",

Me and my father didn't go well for a long time so I think of it more as of a warning, however it turned to make me angry and stressed as he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if I were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all, with me still able to talk.

I was completely fine and confident before that - a nice social group of friends that I made almost everywhere I went. People used to compliment me for my good looks and charm and it made me more confident. However after the breakup things started going downhill. I am not sure if it is the lockdown and quarantine that made me this way.I literally hate meeting people now. People give me anxiety. I force myself to attend meetup plans made by some 4-5 friends that are left. I feel tired to pick up calls from friends, my phone stays on silent all the time. I do not open social media at all and even if I do, all the messages I get are left unanswered. I cannot even do daily chores which involve interacting with people like going to the shop to buy groceries or visiting the barber. Somehow, I push myself to do it. I want to join the gym and start working out again but I am afraid of all the other people at the gym. I am well over my ex girlfriend and do not feel anything about her or the breakup. But , I do refrain from meeting our old mutual friends. My sleep schedule is messed up, I sleep at 1:30 am and wake up at 10:30 am. Previously, I was diagnosed with migraine. Now that I stay at home all day I do not get them. But socialising or going out gives me stress migraines. I know this is not normal and I want to get out of all this. This is a genuine cry for help. About my life goals, I do have a serious passion for Physics and Astronomy. But I end up spending most of my time playing video games.

      "Query: I have struggled with anxiety and depression for 10 years. For the most part I managed it, and I had a decent life and support system. But the past few years everything in my life has gone completely downhill. Its been one thing after another, and just when I think it cannot get any worse, it does. It started when I began to get panic attacks every day, and my social anxiety took a deep dive in college. I dropped out, and have only managed a few classes since then. My mom started having vision problems 3 years ago due to a negligent doctor that failed to inform her that the corneal disease she is had since a teen was rapidly progressing. I have watched her go to all these top specialists week after week for 3 years, and every treatment option has failed. she is always been my best friend and my rock. Watching her go through this, unable to do anything has been horrible. But recently, her mental health took a big turn for the worse. I have had to call 911 on her twice to get her to a psych hospital in the past 3 months. she is truly the only person I have left though. 2 of my closest family members died unexpectedly, the rest of my family does not give a fuck despite my efforts to reach out, my dad is the worst of them all, and I have lost all my friends. I am absolutely terrified for my mom, and I wish so bad I could do something to actually help her. But selfishly, my mental health is at an all time worse. I have never felt more alone and scared in my life, I think about suicide every minute, and I have come up with a plan. I am 23 with no college degree, barely any work history, with no hope for an actual future. I have lost the one person I could got to about anything, because I cannot burden my mom with everything she is going through. I see a therapist every week and it has been zero help. She recommended a residential therapy program for a month, which I feel like is worth a try but the problem is I cannot leave my mom. She has enough vision to do basic things, but she cannot drive, and she needs me right now. No one else in our family understands or cares enough to even call her. I feel so trapped, so hopeless, so terrified. I know that makes me a selfish person, I know I need to suck it up and help my mom. But fuck I do not know how I can keep going like this. I do not see any other way out\n",

Relationship with my (bipolar) girlfriend is on a mutually imposed hiatus because she wants to be alone a lot lately having started a new job after being out of work for over a year and a half needing to adjust I guess and me being someone that enjoys and needs affection. And two days ago my car broke down. Just came home from my work summer event (professional life is going great actually but atm I feel like I am just functioning). Came home and immediately grabbed my guitar and started playing and singing my soul out to the song \"Dead Flowers\" by the Rolling Stones (playing the Townes Van Zandt version). And then it happened. A genuine flashback. 4 years ago I was on a kind of soul searching trip in Vietnam. Sitting on a Rooftop in Hanoi I played guitar and sang by myself and this girl was watching me and after a brief moment of silence she looked me dead in the eye and said \"You sing when you are sad, do not you?\" And it hit me like a truck. I do not know why I am even posting this on here. I guess I juest need to vent. I really really hope that our hiatus will work out. I still do not know how I will get through the next 4 weeks but I will manage somehow because she is worth it to me... we have been really good friends on a deep level for years and our relationship just started in February of this year. At the start of this year everything was going so well. I was out of therapy and started a new career path in IT and then \"we\" happened. And now it feels like everything is falling apart. I just hope I will have the strength to carry on. Because at the moment that is the only thing left for me to do. Again I do not know why I am posting this here.

My stepdad broke me as a person growing up. I am frankly terrified of men, especially loud obnoxious southern men like him who seem to all spout out endless streams of racist hate and blind adherence to tradition. he is the exact definition of the type of person I hate most and I see him in seemingly every man I have to interact with. And as a man, I am expected to be the same. And I am terrified of standing up to them all so I just stay quiet. I am just as much to blame as they are for so much that is wrong in the world because I am so chickenshit I cannot call them out when they are wrong.I spent between the ages of 17-23 absorbed in a religious phase that wasted away any potential I had. I developed a passivity that still lingers to this day, although in a more secular form. I hated my life then and did not want to admit it out of some sense of guilt so I just focused every aspect of my life around anticipating death in hopes of finally getting to reach some illusionary paradise in an afterlife. I did not care about anything. I just wanted \"some job I could tolerate\" to get myself through life until I could finally die. I thought too much and read too much to put it simply and started to question how the world worked. I began to take seriously the possibility that my religion was incorrect and that there might not actually be any meaning, any purpose other than what I defined for myself. I became obsessed with trying to correct my life's trajectory, having wasted away the years I should have been using to achieve education in favor of Christian superstition I had filled my head with. I wanted to be brilliant more than anything. I wanted to try to make up for what I had lost. I tried like hell to get myself straightened out and through school but failed horribly at it. I took on a few jobs trying to pay my way through school and hated every second of them, surrounded constantly by the kind of person my stepdad was. The kind of person I am apparently supposed to be in order to be a good, god-fearing American. I spent another year trying to cling desperately to something I could live for. I got myself out of my mom's house at least so that I was finally away from her own brand of religious nonsense. I successfully got into an actual relationship for the first time in my life and basically just coasted through the next few years. I obviously could not go to school since I had fucked that up. So I just did menial work I hated and coped with life as best as I could. I could not help myself and started seriously studying on my own a couple years ago, right around the beginning of 2018. With no direction or guidance, I basically just gravitated wildly toward any philosophical topic I could find that interested me and began to seriously write in an attempt at parsing my own view of reality and my place in it, as well as where to go from there. This project continued along with my regular visits to therapy and medication that I genuinely believed helped me at the time. My counselor began to suggest I look into trying to return to school again. It was something I was afraid of, but I did start to research it and found that it was possible for me to do it. I went back to school in fall 2019 and loved it. I certainly did not feel any connection to any fellow students, but it gave me regular intellectual challenges and a sense of growth. I was not able to take as many classes in person as I would have liked to because of work, but I tried to make the most of the experience. 2020 everything went to shit for everyone it seemed, and I was no exception. I had started to develop psoriatic arthritis over the past year and this escalated to a point where I lost most of my grip strength and could barely function physically at all. Given that the only things I am qualified to do for pay involve mindlessly moving things around or doing repetitive physical tasks, I felt broken and useless at doing something I hated but had to do no matter what if I wanted to survive. I began to consider suicide for the first time in years and wound up hospitalized. I eventually lost my job in the summer and struggled until I could get some treatment for PsA. When I started infusions I felt immediate relief and regained some sense of utility as a person. I was struggling with balancing classes with the job I was able to get and I jumped around aimlessly between a few jobs. I lost the last job I had in January. I was working at a food bank/thrift store donation center and missed work so I could attend a job interview elsewhere. It was not that I hated the job, I simply hated being there and having to work for a literal church. I hated sitting in employee meetings and hearing everyone ramble about how all the problems were caused by satan and that we needed to remain strong against \"the enemy\" knowing full well that they meant people like me. Useless godless leftist scum who just get in the way. I never got the job I interviewed for and I have been jobless ever since. I lived off savings and unemployment through that time. I lost my patience with school because as always I fail at every endeavor it seems. I felt out of place trying desperately to claw my way into an academic setting I had no business being in as someone from a working class background. I have no patience for formalities, for gatekeeping, or for endless bureaucracy. I cannot fathom suffering through another 6+ years of this to hopefully stand a chance at being valued as someone worth taking seriously when I know statistically that is incredibly unlikely. I do not have contacts, I do not know anyone, I have no shortcuts I can take. I haphazardly withdrew from college in early April citing frustration with my lack of belonging in a field which is more interested in maintaining extant social institutions than upending them. As someone who actively hates society as it is, I have lost nearly all interest in attempting to stabilize it as though we need only vote for the right liberal every four years to make everything better while nothing materially changes and the rest of the world suffers for it. I phrases my withdrawal in a way which understandably appeared to indicate a threat to myself and campus police came and made me go to the ER. Another hospital stay. I have stopped talking to my girlfriend about this stuff. She does not really care or seem to understand anymore and has told me as much at times. She is comfortable with her place in the world where she can rely on the police to handle her problems for her and get rid of those pesky undesirables who make too much noise at night rather than going and having a discussion with them herself. And I am no better. They do not bother me like they seem to bother her, but I cannot shake the fear that the situation will escalate out of control.Anyway I still have no job and I have no desire to return to college, having once again wasted more years of my life. I am tired of going outside every goddamn day and being hounded by people trying to give me religious pamphlets and by my family telling my to pray and everything will get better. I just want someone to take me fucking seriously for once in my life when I beg them to stop shoving religious shit in my face. And I am too fucking cowardly to outright tell them I am an atheist. They cannot even comprehend how such a thing could be possible. It is as though Christianity is some truth embedded in nature itself. I am terrified of finding work again because my work history is terrible and I have become obsessed with the desire to live authentically, which seems impossible to reconcile with the daily process of work. I am an inconvenience on society, which would rather like to just go about their lives praying and patiently waiting for an afterlife they will never get and *insisting* that I and others do the same, going so far as to legislate their preferred world into existence. I just want to get out of everyone is way and be left alone. I am tired of hating their ignorant fucking superstitions to the point where it is exhausting and I just want to die so I can stop bothering them. I am terrified of dying because the only thing I really care about anymore are my two cats. And I do not think my girlfriend would be able to keep them since her family is allergic and I cannot stand the thought of them suffering but I cannot stand the thought of suffering myself. I am a bitter asshole and I just want to see the world look like it might someday be a tolerable place to live in, but we are just going to cook ourselves to death slowly while making a quick buck along the way. I cannot write for shit anymore. My mind is everywhere. I do not know how the fuck I can work like this and I do not even want to at all. I do not do anything but sit around playing video games these days because they give me some semblance of control over *something*. I run a D&amp;D campaign every week. And I have my cats. These are small things but they are all I have anymore. I do not think humanity is ever going to unfuck itself and I do not want to sit around watching it get worse. But I simultaneously do not want to let go of these brief, tiny pleasures. I am trying to figure out a way to just stay out of everyone is way so I can at least live out my cats' lives. In a sense I am back where I was before. Just waiting to die. Wanting to \"just get by\" long enough to finally be rid of it. I hate this. Just want to get out of everyone is way\n",

      "My face is swollen and so is my body, my wounds won't heal, I can't exercise and feel fatigued every day, my veins bulge and I have extremely pale skin, my eyes are also bulging(my brother pointed this out to me and I thought I was the only one who thought this), my teeth are cracking and my gums are pale, numbness in every single part of my body, blood pools, anhedonia, and dissociation, impaired memory and I can't even count or decide what to eat, have to double check my spelling and memory and even then I forget, bathroom struggles, insomnia, weak bones, head feels full and swollen, fingernails have started to club believe it or not, hair and nails don't grow, blue extremities and struggling to breathe, cant hold head up and body feels very heavy to carry, sharp pains around my body aching pains, blurred vision and double vision, i can't even walk anymore and my ligaments crack all the time. pre 2017 this would not have been the case because i injured myself very severly and do not realise the damage i have done. doctors are saying nothings wrong with me but thats not true, the problems have built up over time which i suspect is a problem with my vascular system but getting seen in the UK is very hard. i have also bought a healthcare plan which is not private health insurance but all that i can afford(£11 monthly). The extent of damage it has done to me made me realize that i may not ever be normal again IF i ever get treated that is, and so i feel like my only option is to die. I know some people say that people who are crippled and have disabilities can have long satisfying lives but that is not the life for me, especially considering there was nothing wrong with me before. i always dream to be that way again but i know i won't get that anymore and i wont be happy at all, the damage it has done to me probably affected my brain to the point where i dont think it will ever recover, or my heart, or my bones, or my optic nerves so i don't think it's worth living if I have long-lasting complications.\n",

      "And also the cause was self-harm, I know it sounds silly but it could have been prevented. I was mentally ill and the things I did weren't normal, looking back at it now and it's all my parent's fault, they convoluted my idea of normal since I was a little kid. I never got the help i needed not even for my selective mutism and now I'm screwed for good. I'm no good anymore and worthless, I can't even make or remember memories and this isn't the depression speaking since I had an urge to fix my life and get back on track. Now I have a wound that will never heal. My parents were extremely toxic and detrimental since my youth, my only fantasies were ones of running away. I don't have much contact with them and am stuck in the house with them. In 2017 I self-harmed so bad my left side went number and weaker and I have been that way ever since. Now it's caused so many problems because of something pressing on my vascular system causing harm to my entire body, but I am told there is nothing wrong with me, even by the most toxic people of all (my parents) they got so sick of me trying to reach out for help, my father shouted at me and sent me into a burst of tears, I choked on my tea but I persisted and called the doctor and asked for an appointment, he took me to the docs but I feel like I'm in a losing game. I don't really have any positive options anymore and am in so much pain 24/7. I've lost my sight somewhat, hearing, function, mobility, emotions, and cognition and am basically becoming a vegetable. Even if I do get treated it will be too late as the damage has left permanent wounds. I've shown someone pics before and they have admitted its pretty messed up what I have been through. I am struggling for answers but at the least, I can get a diagnosis just so I can shove it in people's faces and prove them wrong. But other than that I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I got tired from making this post I took a few breaks and am still lethargic.\n",

      "My doctor that i recently visited also noticed that i was looking a bit pale so for me thats been a relief, he was quite attentive and offered to give me a blood test which is next month so i have to struggle to next month. He weighed me(im 48kg now) and we talked about my symptoms and I did mention to him it has to do with my vascular system, it's now a test of time to see what will happen. Realistically I don't think my prognosis is too good. But people are becoming more attentive to how messed up my body is so I think thats a good but far too little too late now\n",

      "Query: I am one of those former gifted kids that was in all the advanced classes basically until I hit high school and got depressed. Then I was just passing regular classes with ok grades, no problem. Parents are evangelical christians and think that therapy is either just for literal psychopaths or an excuse for me to get hooked on drugs. Fine, whatever, I can live without it. I hit college and things go ok for a couple of years. Then the pandemic hits, and everything goes to hell. Its so easy with online classes to say Ill do it later, especially when they are asynchronous. Ill do it later turns into Ill do two days worth of work tomorrow and then I can catch up on everything over the weekend. Except, you never do. And then the anxiety hits, and you feel awful for not doing work, so its on your mind 24/7. But you do not actually have the motivation to go do the work, and you end up burying yourself in some instant gratification trying to hide from the anxiety and get out of actually putting effort into anything. Except, this just feeds the anxiety more, which makes you delve into more instant gratification, and the cycle repeats endlessly. This has been my life for the past year and a half. Its maddening, and I honestly regret not killing myself when I was 16. At least then I would not have to deal with this. Even with only one class to focus on this summer the cycle is as vicious as ever, with no end in sight besides failure. I just want to break the cycle but it does a real good job of keeping you sucked in. Depression + Anxiety has destroyed my ability to function as a student\n",

Currently helping out my sister in law with what kind of lie (that is based in truth) to tell her boss why she needs a semi urgent doctors appointment. Because even though employers \"say\" they support mental health, we all know the levels of acceptance and denial in the work force, and she does not want to look \"weak\" and \"emotional\" in front of work competitors and miss out on promotions. Currently we are going with the \"doctors appt for sleep apnea\" and \"doctors appointment for anemia\" rout (since anxiety induced insomnia is part of the problem, and anemia really could be part of it). Obviously not going to mention the suicidal ideation part! Figuring out the best lies to tell your employer when getting urgent help\n",

If you are none of them you are not collocutor here so I do not care your insults and humiliations\\*&amp;#x200B;It is been said that, moral values and morality even religions have been created for weaks.

This is just few thoughts for weak, mentally ill and outcast.&amp;#x200B;For a long time I have been thinking on source of morality-the rules for not harming others, not lyging exc- what are those sources? It has been religion throughout history. If you look at closely you can see how egoism is the essence of Christianity, Islam even Buddhism.

Even if you are sick, have been bullied, harmed you will seek heaven, heavenly father or good karma-rebirth-reincarnation-just be the good boy\". Ever since we undestood evolution, real nature of world. Ever since we understood how fake this thought of god, rebirth is. There is one dangerous spirit circulates around us-especially weaks. We have seek the real nature of question \"what is the good if there is no reward for my moral actions?\" Apperantly there is no reward for pro-social human actions. It is the opposite, sociopaths atttract both girls and men. And when we know that there is no reward nor punisment-in eternarl level-our chains are broken. Now our new divine command comes from our egos. We do not need YWH to have holy orders.&amp;#x200B;So we must seek for our own desires. This is what humans do already.

So currently, i have a lot of mania, but very little depression. and the mania doesn't seem too extreme - my therapist thought it was BP 2 but the psych testing came back BP 1, which she agrees with now.

I am a mom and wife, and my family loves me. So I really hesitate to medicate. But I also wonder if I should keep taking Lexapro? My therapist said withdrawl from that is ugly, so she doesn't recommend it. But maybe it's been triggering my mania? I was also diagnosed with mixed personality disorder, mainly borderline with a heavy dose of narcissism. So naturally, I am very concerned with medication that could affect my skin (already went through struggles with acne while younger, not going to do that again) and also obsess about my weight.

      "Query: This is not a cry for help or a pity party post, but I am looking for input on whoever reads the post and has any insight on ECT or TMS therapy...I am not doing well mentally. I have not been for a long, long time. With MDD (Unipolar) among other things such as GAD and PTSD, the low cycles come in waves, but the highs are always mild and do not always seem to last all that long.I have been told countless times that I am such a negative person, I complain a lot, or I never seem like I am having fun. I get blamed for a mental health disorder that I have been battling for years and have tried countless medications, therapists, psychiatrists, holistic supplements, meditation, testosterone therapy, to name the healthy and positive actions I have taken. I have also been dependent on alcohol and drugs, used sex and intimacy as a means of feeling better about myself, self-harm, attempted suicide for the negatives...Truth is, I really want to live and be happy and enjoy my life, but sometimes, especially lately, every day seems like an uphill battle, every day I have to fight myself just to get out of bed in the morning and go to work (and I have a good job and am doing well financially), every day, I worry that my mental illness is pushing people away in my life (fact: it has), every day I worry that I am ruining my relationship because of my inability to manage my emotions and mental health issues. I want so desperately to not feel like this anymore and I am running out of options that I have not already tried.I started looking into ECT (Electro-convulsive therapy) treatment as a last resort for treating my mental health issues and I was nervous about the risks associated (such as retrograde amnesia). I do not want to risk zapping away memories in my brain and losing part of who I am, but had decided to start looking into it as all else has failed so far. I was very fortunate to find that there is a safer alternative that is only available medically here in Austin. TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) is a safer alternative to ECT with less side effects and is less intrusive.I was worried about ECT because these treatments are a multi-week long process and ECT makes you lose short term memory temporarily and you need someone to pick you up and drop you off from the clinic, and it would have meant I would be unlikely able to work during the process. TMS does not have this same effect and I would be able to do it more independently and still be able to work.If I am being honest, I am still nervous about all of it. I have my first TMS consultation this afternoon. I want my brain to be healthy again, I want to be able to enjoy my life. I am so blessed to have the people in my life that I do, but I am just as frustrated at my lack of progress as anybody else who knows me and has had to deal with me. It certainly sucks so fucking much to always be told that I am not doing enough, that I create my own situation. If I have learned anything throughout all of this is that I do not have control over my emotions, I do not have control over my well-being, I do not have control over my life. But I want to. And I am getting to that point where maybe I do need it all zapped away and start afresh.

      "Query: I am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. I am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years, I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. When I was younger it was not a huge deal, but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a long-lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.The thing is, I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. Once the initial excitement wears off, I go back to being aloof, insecure and self-centered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding. I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship, I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.On top of it all, I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. I am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, I have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although I have tried, I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is, I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again, but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that, I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry (two semesters left), but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school, and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? If so, how did you manage? I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point, and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. Thank you for reading.

Right now the one on my foot has been growing over the last 5 years, I have smalls one I recently noticed on my stomach and leg (and other foot), and I just hope whatever I am noticing on my face is not a tumor.

Ill have no irl friends, I am not close to any of my family, and Ill have tumors grow on me and make me look like a hideous monster (I feel like a POS for saying that, because it is my medical condition and other people do suffer worse than me even at my age and younger). I really do not see a future of happiness with this condition. I already hate my life as it is, and now I have this to worry about. I was born with a genetic condition out of my control.

I 100% believe I am an empathetic person. When I tell people that I understand what they feel, I can literally feel it. I make other peoples problems my problems. I decide Okay this person is clearly over barren with their difficulties that if maybe I just take a little weight off of their shoulders, they could breathe. After all, I would want someone to do that for me.People can never really reciprocate the feelings correctly. I know that sounds odd. There are no wrong ways to feel, but something about the demeanor of those i help really tears me down. I am slowly giving, giving, giving until I am all out.I can tell that recently my depression is worsening. I cannot tell if it is a hormonal wave, but it is so extreme. I have not showered in like two and a half days. But its been longer before. I am trying to find my footing, but I can feel myself mentally drift. Just a morning or two ago I was incredibly happy I stayed up all night just to clean the house for my mom. She is a handful another post for later. My mom now is so cruel and treats me no less than a cleaning lady. I had a relationship with her when I was smaller, but she tries to get me to hang out with her, I never stay long. Everyone I have ever met loves my mom. The only people who really know what is going on is my boyfriend and my dad. We label her as narcissistic because I did not recognize she was so mean because I was so used to it. Today, I was crying for many reasons. First it was because my anxiety was bad and I did not really have anyone to talk to. Then, it was because I felt guilty that I accidentally kept my exs pictures in the My Eyes Only section of snapchat (my boyfriend did not care as long as I deleted them). I think I might be bipolar. I feel like I am blowing things out of proportion when I say that, but I might need to be reevaluated. By a psychologist, not a therapist that will befriend my mom and become BFFS WITH. I played myself and lied to her the entire time I was her client. I was already diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was taking lexapro, but stopped because I started taking a whole 20 mg pill that was supposed to be cut in half. My dumbass. But when I took it consistently 3 weeks in a row in rehab, I hated how it trapped me in my own brain.

Everyday they gives us those tasks even in Sunday we cannot have a break, and there happened the time when I and my friends did not sleep for 2 days straight, those task can take our time half the day and if we get evaluation(and punishment if we did some mistake even for the simplest mistake) after finishing the tasks it can finish until 10pm , I have been stressed out because of this from the past month and really make me exhausted. I often wake up with regret because of knowing there will be so many task to do, and not only that negative thoughts like \"i will get punished for not doing the task perfectly\" often make a fog in my brain and makes me cannot think clearly and worsen my stress. I became overthink because the 11grader seniors will really be mad and badmouthing us for not doing our tasks perfectly. I have been thinking of quitting the student council, but my worries are if I quit, those seniors will look down at me and our relation in school will be bad. I cannot take a good sleep for weeks now because anxiety keeps me checking what is update in my students council group chat. Again, so many negative thoughts in my mind because of that.

Right now I feel alone even though I have people who support me. I do not want to give in to depression, but I also do not have life goals, motivation or really anything that excites me. I do not have a bad life, but I do not have anything going on now (no job, no healthy hobbies, no meeting with people). I was not fully okay when I still attended school either which makes me worried/scared that this feeling will come back even when I will finally have a job that occupies my mind.I am stressed about having to juggle and fix so many things in my life at once: work, friendships, house chores, anxiety, depression, hobbies, habits, therapist... it is too much, and it feels like I am going nowhere. It feels like that even though I try to be better, get better, it works only for some time then all comes crashing down. As if it was a sign that my efforts are worthless.I really want this war in my head to end. Even though anxiety and depression have been giving me a hell of a time in these past months, somehow I still have hope left. Somehow I still do not want to give up. I feel like I am super strong but at the same time I feel weak. Not always, just rarely.

And if my natural burn rate is 2000 calories a day and I eat 500, that is only 1500. So I need to burn 2000 more calories a day to achieve around a pound a day to keep my 6.67 pound a week loss.I am already dealing with really bad depression, which causes me to constantly overeat and binge because it makes me feel better, so now I need to control that to not get ridiculed by my fucking family. My mom looked so disappointed and disgusted when I told her I was 167.

She seemed like she was new and when I asked her for the fragrance I wanted she seemed confused and said she was going to get someone to help me. She came back with two women, and they’re all staring at me while I say what I want. Then one of the women she brought back started asking me questions, I wasn’t prepared for this and I sort of shut down. She asked me what I was currently wearing and I lied and said I didn’t wear anything currently, then she asked me if I would wear something sweeter than the fragrance I had picked out and I just shook my head and looked at some other bottles of perfume. I acted mostly dismissive towards the three women because I was so uncomfortable and just wanted the situation to end.

      "Query: I am twenty nine and I mostly want to disappear. I do not really want to die. What scares me the most is my ability to endure, and endure, and then endure some more. My life was designed to be shit from the moment I was born. My whole family is mentally ill; my mother is a bipolar who only got on meds well into her forties, my father is a high-ish functioning autistic, and my brother has had schizophreneia since he was fifteen. I have been abused by my parents for years, I have had two major depression episodes, one when I was twelve and one at eighteen, anxiety and panic attacks since I remember myself. I was never taken to a doctor as a child, I was seen by a psychiatrist later in life and was put on meds but could not tolerate them at all. I have never been in therapy. I have always been either overweight or skin and bones, I am socially awkward and too argumentative and bitchy and nerdy, all of which qualities are unforgivable in females who are not attractive. I have always been very introverted though it is not in my nature to be introverted, I have let people take advantage of me and I have abused myself in various ways. I never had an adult or older person who can guide me in any way, the only one for a while was my aunt, who would only help me financially, and since she told me that the reason she did it was so that I would be her nurse when she grew old, I have not spoken to her. I have only one friend, who lives in another city, who miraculously escaped the purge I did a few years ago. I literally cut ties with many people overnight in a fit of self respect. All my friends have been fake, because I do not have the ability to be vulnerable around people enough to form real connections. I have a boyfriend since three years ago who is from another country and I have not seen in a year and a half because of covid. I am a dropout, and right now I am completely broke and cannot work because of covid, and my boyfriend lost his job and is looking for one that will allow him to live overseas which seems impossible so far. We are both poor. Neither has a house, or money. I love him so much and he is the first person I was ever able to open up to the degree that I have. he is been with me through thick and thin, even though I am a horrible bitch and take out my anger on him sometimes. I am sometimes very toxic towards him. Intimacy often makes my skin crawl if I really think about it. He has his own baggage, but nowhere near as bad as mine. he is in therapy and keeps telling me I need to get a therapist. I think about breaking up with him all the time, because he deserves better. Sometimes I pretend to joke and tell him he should stay where he is and get a nice cute girlfriend with money, but I really do think about it. I think that if I do break up with him, it will have to be at a time when I will be able to off myself soon after, so that I will not feel pain for long. I have told him all these thoughts, and I think I freaked the shit out of him but he listened. he is the only good thing in my life, and that is why I feel like I need to protect him, by stepping aside.I feel like I am poison. I feel responsible for everything. Shame and guilt and the past stain everything. I have survivor's guilt over my brother, why did he get my mother's genes and not me? I have immeasurable anger towards my parents, my controlling psychotic mother and my father who has only checked in with his family to vent his anger. I feel contempt and envy towards sunny, happy people, even people with problems, even people with some problems, or one big problem. I am jealous of those too. I feel like no one can understand, I feel like no one has it as bad as I have it. Or maybe they do understand that is why they look at me with pity. I hate them, I hate people up close. The idea of people is much more appealing than the reality of stupidity, entitlement and selfishness. And yet am I any better? I want to disappear and fake my death and live away from society. I see people that leave everything behind and go live alone in some jungle or whatever, and I am so, so jealous of them. To constantly live in the moment, because you have no choice, because it is a matter of survival. I feel trapped and suffocating, and even though I do want to live, I want to be the person I feel I was meant to be, smart, funny, capable, I do not think it is meant to be. I feel like a naive idiot for having any dreams at all. I t does not help that I actually am naive and I have many life and money choices that really worsened things. I;ve been suicidal before and it was much more severe. I was this close and was stopped last minute. This time it does not feel urgent at all, it feels unavoidable. Steady but surely. The scary thing that I keep asking myself, is how much more can you take? The answer to that is: probably a lot more. And that I just cannot live with. I am emotionally burnt out. I am depressed. The thought of having to deal with anything is awful.I do not know why I am posting this. Probably to validate how shitty everything is. Everyone around me is acting as if nothing is wrong. Crazy shit happens and it is forgotten the next moment, brushed under the rug. I probably just want to be told that it could be worse, but not much. That my life is indeed an unequivocal clusterfuck. My problems are just too many and too unsolvabl\n",

It's constant, not one second of peace, sleeping is very difficult. I've visited doctors, blood tests are normal. I even managed to do an endoscopy, which has always been one of my worst nightmares. It showed just a mild gastritis, nothing to explain my severe constant pain. I've been taking treatment but there is absolutely no difference. Doctor ordered a CT scan and I was hesitant but after some sleepless nights I decided to go for it. Well the result came right now and there isn't much wrong, just a fatty liver and some benign stuff with my prostate. Now I am sad I've irradiated myself for nothing (although, I don't really regret it, never had such pain in my life). The risk is like a 0,2% increase in cancer but some believe the risk might be a little overestimated for CT scans. I will never accept another CT scan in my life, unless it's an emergency.

I started going to therapy last month or so and I was progressing well. I was diagnosed with dysthymia and I was going into a more stable and functional state. I started to do my schoolwork again and I was managing my stress and intrusive thoughts better. I was proud that I was recovering and I was so excited to getting my life back together. But I guess I spoke too soon and I ended up relapsing this week.

I am pretty angry at myself right now, because I feel like I wasted the efforts of my therapist, my friends (who helped me a lot with dealing with my bad stuff) and I feel like I wasted my own effort. what is worse is that being angry at myself just fuels my desire to kill myself even more. I do not have the guts to tell my friends about what I am feeling or thinking cos they are going through their own problems right now and I feel ashamed to even tell them because I am an awful friend cos I suck at being there for them emotionally (I am still learning how to be empathetic and how to comfort others, nobody really taught me as a kid so I am still developing on that aspect). My family does not acknowledge I exist anymore, and I am falling behind my school work. I just want to end things, because I just do not have a desire to live anymore.
